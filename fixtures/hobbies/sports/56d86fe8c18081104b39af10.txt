Seattle Seahawks safety Kam Chancellor was trying to get information on a Washington gym Wednesday evening when two women called the police on him because they thought he was trying to rob the place.

Chancellor shared the story on Twitter.

They told the cops I was trying to rob the place because I was looking into the glass asking for help. I took a picture of the two employees

Good thing the cops know I'm a good guy and stealing isn't in my blood. I work for everything I get

Chancellor, who runs fitness boot camps for women, wrote on Twitter that he was looking into buying the gym.

According to Chancellor, the property he was looking at was the Redmond Athletic Club, which shut down earlier this week. The building, however, still has employees working out of it.

Attempts to reach a representative at the gym were unsuccessful.
