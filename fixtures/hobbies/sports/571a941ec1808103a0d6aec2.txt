HOUSTON -- Stephen Curry says he'll be very surprised if his sprained right ankle keeps him out in Game 4 of the Golden State Warriors' first-round playoff series against the Houston Rockets on Sunday.

Curry was injured in the series opener and missed the last two games. Golden State won the first one without him, but Houston took Game 3 on Thursday night to cut the series deficit to 2-1.

Last year's MVP was on the bench for Game 2, but watched from the locker room Thursday night because he didn't bring a suit to Houston. Though he's still listed as questionable for the next game, Curry sounded pretty confident that he wouldn't be on the bench again.

When asked if he'd go buy a suit in case he doesn't play on Sunday, he said: "I will not be going to any suit store."
