WWE Superstar Adam Rose was arrested early Wednesday morning in Hillsborough County, Florida, and is facing a pair of charges.

According to Dave Scherer of PWInsider.com, police said Rose was charged with tampering with a witness and battery domestic violence. He remains in custody.  

The 36-year-old veteran is serving a 60-day suspension for violating WWE's talent wellness policy.

Rose has been outspoken since the ban and provided a note from his doctor suggesting that the positive test was due to the use of Adderall, which he was prescribed to treat ADHD:

Here is the doctors note once again! I did nothing but take prescribed medication. #WWE knew about it for a year pic.twitter.com/1IFfvEJwV7

The South Africa native also explained the reasoning behind his decision to be vocal rather than fade into the background during his discipline:

I am absolutely ok with whatever the #WWE decides. All I care about is looking after my family... as I said before... wrestling or not.

Rose has been part of WWE since signing a developmental deal to work at Florida Championship Wrestling in 2010. He was known as Leo Kruger for much of his tenure before switching to the Rose gimmick in NXT in 2014.

The former FCW Florida heavyweight champion has been part of the Social Outcasts stable with Heath Slater, Bo Dallas and Curtis Axel since January.

WWE has used Rose primarily as an enhancement talent who makes his opponents look good while piling up losses in his own right.

Aside from the charges against him, police have not yet revealed specifics regarding Rose's arrest and the circumstances surrounding it.
