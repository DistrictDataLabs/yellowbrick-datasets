Seeking insurance at quarterback in case Marcus Mariota gets injured again, the Tennessee Titans agreed to a deal with veteran Matt Cassel on Wednesday.      

ESPN.com's Paul Kuharsky and John Glennon of the Tennessean reported Cassel's one-year pact with the Titans. 

The 33-year-old Cassel is becoming one of the NFL's most well-traveled quarterbacks. He has played for the New England Patriots, Kansas City Chiefs, Minnesota Vikings, Buffalo Bills and Dallas Cowboys since being drafted in 2005. 

Cassel's greatest success came in 2008 with the Patriots. He started 15 games after Tom Brady tore his ACL in the season opener, completing a career-high 63.4 percent of his passes for 3,693 yards and 21 touchdowns. 

While not able to consistently replicate that success, Cassel did throw a career-high 27 touchdowns while helping lead the Chiefs to an AFC West title in 2010. That was his last full-time starting gig in the NFL, though he's appeared in at least three games in each of the last five seasons. 

Last season, during his time as a starter in Dallas after Tony Romo was injured, Cassel was one of Pro Football Focus' lowest-rated quarterbacks (h/t Rotoworld's Evan Silva):

The good news for Tennessee is it doesn't need Cassel to come in as a starting quarterback. Mariota showed great promise as a rookie with 2,818 passing yards, 252 rushing yards and 22 total touchdowns in 12 games before his season ended in Week 15 because of a knee injury. 

Bringing in a competent backup who is capable of helping Mariota develop, as well as stepping up to play in case of an injury, is a smart move for the Titans. Cassel has been a consummate professional everywhere he's played and will fit in nicely with the Titans next season.
