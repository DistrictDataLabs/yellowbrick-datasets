Kansas City will not recoup the two draft picks forfeited for violating the league's Anti-Tampering Policy in their March, 2015 recruitment of free agent Jeremy Maclin.

The Chiefs' appeal of anti-tampering sanctions was denied by NFL, NFL Media Insider Ian Rapoport reported, via a league source.

The organization was informed Monday that they will indeed surrender their third-round pick in 2016 and sixth-round pick in 2017, as originally outlined by NFL Executive Vice President of Football Operations Troy Vincent last month.

Although the appeal was denied, Commissioner Roger Goodell did reduce the team's fine from $250,000 to $200,000 and coach Andy Reid's fine from $75,000 to $60,000.

Maclin played under Reid in Philadelphia before signing a five-year, $55 million deal with Kansas City in March 2015.

Chiefs chairman and CEO Clark Hunt released the following statement on the matter:

"We appreciate the opportunity to make our appeal on this matter, and we acknowledge the minor reduction in fines imposed. However, we continue to believe that the facts of this case combined with the league's inconsistent enforcement of its tampering policies do not warrant the most severe penalty for player-related tampering in league history. 

"Having exhausted our options under the appeal process, we are turning the page on this issue and look forward to continuing our preparations for the 2016 season."
