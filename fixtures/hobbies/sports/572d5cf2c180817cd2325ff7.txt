Arizona Coyotes captain Shane Doan has spent the past two decades with the organization, beginning as a 19-year-old when the Coyotes were still the original Winnipeg Jets in 1995.

After completing his 20th year in 2015-16, the 39-year-old is set to become an unrestricted free agent July 1. But he has no intentions of retiring yet, as he told NHL Network on Friday (via John Gambadoro of Arizona Sports 98.7).

Doan has remained consistent as his career has progressed in Arizona. He's scored 20 or more goals in 13 of his 20 years, including 28 in 2015-16, which was his largest output since he tallied 31 in 2008-09.

He is the franchise leader in goals with 396, passing the great Dale Hawerchuk this season. The NHL showed his hat trick, which helped him tie the record:

Unfortunately for Doan, the Coyotes have been consistently mediocre and haven't made the playoffs since 2012, leading the team to fire general manager Don Maloney in April and hire the youngest general manager in NHL history, John Chayka. 

The 26-year-old was just six when Doan started his career. Now he's the man Doan will have to negotiate with for a new contract to stay with the Coyotes.

Given his age, he's unlikely to sign a long extension. Instead, he could reach an agreement that's similar to the one 44-year-old Jaromir Jagr signed with the Florida Panthers. On Thursday, Jagr signed a one-year, $4 million deal, per Chris Johnston of Sportsnet.

There's little to suggest that Doan won't produce again, and as long as the price is right, he should be welcomed back to Arizona with open arms for his 21st season.
