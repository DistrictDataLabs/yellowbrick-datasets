Knight Dealing with Sports Hernia

Saturday, April 2

It will be the second game in a row that Knight will have missed after he was absent for Phoenix's 106-99 loss to the Washington Wizards Friday. The Suns announced before the game that Knight was suffering from a sports hernia.

Scoring 19.6 points per game, Knight was on pace for a career year this season before injuries started slowing him down. The 24-year-old missed 21 games after a groin injury forced him to the bench from Jan. 21 through March 9.  

He has been one of the few bright spots of a disastrous Suns season that has included the firing of head coach Jeff Hornacek and the trade of forward Markieff Morris.

While Knight is a talented scorer, the Suns have struggled this season, and he's been on the wrong end of some unfortunate plays, as SportsCenter showed:

Phoenix is even worse without Knight, though. Of the 21 games he missed after suffering the groin injury, the team lost 17.

Injuries are nothing new to the Suns. At one point in January, seven different players were out.

The Suns are going to have a difficult time replacing Knight's scoring. Ronnie Price and Archie Goodwin could see a bump in minutes in the backcourt, with Locke reporting Price is in line to start against Utah. Phoenix would normally rely on leading scorer Eric Bledsoe to step in, but he is done for the season after suffering a torn meniscus in December. 

It's just another cruel twist in a Suns season that is on pace to be their worst since 1968-69.
