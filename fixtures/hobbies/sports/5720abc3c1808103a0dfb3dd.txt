Racing 92 have suspended their prop forward Martin Castrogiovanni after pictures emerged of the rugby player partying in Las Vegas with Paris Saint-Germain footballer Zlatan Ibrahimovic.

According to the Daily Telegraph, Castrogiovanni told the club he could not feature in the team’s Champions Cup showdown with Leicester Tigers at the weekend due to the fact he had family matters to attend to in Argentina. 

But photos emerged on social media of him accompanied by Ibrahimovic and other PSG stars Marco Verratti, Javier Pastore and Salvatore Sirigu, who had been given some time off by manager Laurent Blanc having already secured the Ligue 1 title. Here’s a snap of the Italian alongside Ibrahimovic, per BBC Sport:

Racing 92 released a statement in which they confirmed the 34-year-old’s suspension and labelled it “as a precautionary measure prior to launching legal proceedings,” per the previous source.






            
            Racing coped well despite Castrogiovanni's absence.
        

Castrogiovanni, who has represented Italy an impressive 119 times, joined Racing 92 from Toulon in 2015 and played an important role in their Champions Cup campaign prior to the semi-final tie.

However, the team didn’t miss the influence of the prop, as they notched a 19-16 win over the Tigers to book their place in the final. Castrogiovanni, who will be suspended for that historic occasion for the club, will be left to ponder whether or not his trip to Vegas was really worth it.
