Former NBA Development League All-Star Eric Griffin was arrested Friday and charged with attempted murder.

According to Sam Gardner of FoxSports.com, the 25-year-old Griffin and 23-year-old Daquan Lundy were taken into custody in Orlando, Florida, after allegedly firing gunshots at 24-year-old Treavor Glover in the early-morning hours of April 27.

Per Gardner, Glover told police he was struck with one grazing shot to the forehead, although it isn't known whether Griffin or Lundy is the person alleged to have fired that shot.

The brother of Glover's girlfriend, Gino Nicolas, was killed in a drive-by shooting April 16. According to Gardner, Lundy was also shot in that incident. Griffin was reportedly friends with Nicolas, and it is rumored that Glover is friends with the suspected shooter in the Nicolas case, according to Bay 9 News' Stephanie Bechara.

Since spending two seasons at Campbell University, Griffin has bounced between several different professional leagues and teams.

He played on the summer-league rosters of the Los Angeles Lakers, Miami Heat, Dallas Mavericks, Los Angeles Clippers, Cleveland Cavaliers and Detroit Pistons between 2012 and 2015.



Griffin has never played in an NBA regular-season game, but he enjoyed stints in Italy, Puerto Rico, Venezuela and the United Arab Emirates.

He most notably made the NBA D-League All-Star Game in 2015 when he averaged 19.0 points and 6.6 rebounds per game for the Texas Legends. 

Griffin is being held without bond in Orange County jail after pleading not guilty at his arraignment Monday, per Gardner.

His motion to set a bond will be heard in court Wednesday.
