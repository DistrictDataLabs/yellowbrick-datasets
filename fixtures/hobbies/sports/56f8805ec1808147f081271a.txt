No shoe, no problem.

During the first half against the top-seeded Virginia Cavaliers in the Elite Eight on Sunday, Syracuse Orange forward Tyler Lydon shook off his left sneaker and continued to play.

After setting a screen for Michael Gbinije, Lydon popped open behind the three-point line. The solo-shoed freshman proceeded to nail the triple, cutting Virginia’s lead to 30-21.
