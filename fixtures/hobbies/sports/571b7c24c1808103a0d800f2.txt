Two-time finalist Ali Carter suffered a surprise 13-11 defeat by Alan McManus in the second round of the World Championship.

Carter, who knocked out champion Stuart Bingham in the first round, led 5-3 and 9-7 after the first two sessions.

McManus won four consecutive frames to lead 11-9 and, although Carter made a century to trail 12-11, the Scot took the one he needed.

Mark Selby leads qualifier Sam Baird 9-7. They resume at 19:00 BST.

The revival of McManus 

Scotland's McManus has reached the quarter-finals in Sheffield five times in 20 appearances since his debut in 1991.

He failed to qualify between 2007 and 2012 but will now face either Ricky Walden or John Higgins in the last-eight as he attempt to match his best performance of two semi-finals in the 1990s.

"I got the ideal start on Saturday having been 9-7 down," said 45-year-old McManus, who is the oldest player left in the tournament.

"I won a frame on the black ball and relaxed after that. I wanted to be 10-10 but at 11-9 ahead was huge for me. 

"I still practice a lot and work hard at the game. I enjoy it. Sometimes I am out there looking around and think 'I might not be here again, it is a special place to be'." 

Carter, though, was critical of the table at the Crucible, calling it "the worst I have ever played on".

"The conditions were horrific, there were kicks every other shot and big bounces off the cushions," said the Englishman.

"But it was a disgusting performance from me. Alan dictated the match and I was powerless to do anything about it. I just wanted to smash the place up at the interval."
