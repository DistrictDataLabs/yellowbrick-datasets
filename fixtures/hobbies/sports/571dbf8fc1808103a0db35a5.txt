As Reggie Jackson's three-point attempt from the top of the key fell short at the buzzer Sunday night, the Detroit Pistons lost to the Cleveland Cavaliers, 100-98, and were swept out of the first round of the playoffs.

Jackson felt that he was fouled on his attempt and let the refs know it while still on the court. According to Nick Friedell of ESPN.com, "Jackson wants a system in place for refs just like there is for players in regard to being penalized for blowing calls."

He spoke about his proposition in a postgame press conference, per Ben Golliver of Sports Illustrated:

The fifth-year pro, who averaged 14.3 points per game in the series, made some good points in terms of everyone being held accountable for their actions, but he needs to be careful, as the NBA does not take criticism of officials by players and coaches lightly. In fact, the league fined Jackson's head coach, Stan Van Gundy, $25,000 following comments he made about officials during an on-court interview between quarters during Game 1.

Tim Bontemps of the Washington Post took it a step further when analyzing the way Jackson remained on the court and let the officials know what he thought about the non-call, noting he thought Jackson may have made contact with the official:



Hard to tell for sure on TV feed, but looked like he might have made contact with the official, and definitely was heated with the no-call.

The problem with the situation is that officiating can be a flexible thing. Plays can be interpreted a number of different ways and officials call those plays accordingly as they see fit, even if other officials might have called them differently. 

Jackson is going to have a tough time getting the NBA to adopt his idea, and he will likely be lighter in the wallet because of it.
