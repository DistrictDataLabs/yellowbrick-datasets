Miami's lack of salary cap space won't keep Dolphins football czar Mike Tannenbaum from probing the market. 

NFL Media Insider Ian Rapoport reported that Mario Williams is heading to Miami to visit the team, per a source informed of the Dolphins' plans. 

The Buffalo Bills recently cut Williams after the worst season of his career. The defensive end was roundly criticized for taking plays off in 2015 and openly complaining about his role in Rex Ryan's defense. 

The No. 7 free agent on Around The NFL's top 99 list, Williams would add pass-rushing help off the edge alongside Ndamukong Suh if he signed in Miami. 

Bringing in Williams could be a signal to pass rusher Cameron Wake that the team is willing to move on if he doesn't take a pay cut or work out an extension to lower his cap number. Williams could also be a backup plan in case Olivier Vernon -- whom the Dolphins transition tagged -- landed a massive deal Miami couldn't match. Or, in another scenario, the Dolphins could sign Williams and rescind Vernon's tag.

Williams should have an ample market, so we expect him to take several other visits before signing. The 31 year old is a good candidate to sign a one-year, prove-it deal if he doesn't like any long-term offers sent his way. With a bounce-back season, Williams would be in for another big payday next offseason on the open market.
