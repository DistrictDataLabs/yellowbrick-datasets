Britons Asha Philip and Dina Asher-Smith are into the 60m semi-finals at the World Indoor Championships.

Asher-Smith qualified fourth fastest in Portland in 7.12 seconds, while Philip was second in her heat in 7.18.

It was a disappointing night for Lynsey Sharp and Adelle Tracey, who failed to reach the 800m final.

Meanwhile, in a meeting in Slovakia, Tom Bosworth broke the 20km walk British record, finishing in one hour 20 minutes and 41 seconds.

The 26-year-old Briton took one minute 22 seconds off the previous best, set by Ian McCombie in 1988.
