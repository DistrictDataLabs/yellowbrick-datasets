Dolphins on Schwartz's List

Thursday, March 3

Schwartz's agent, Deryk Gilmore, told Barry Jackson of the Miami Herald that the free-agent guard would "love to play" with the Miami Dolphins next year.

“When healthy," Gilmore said, per Jackson, "he’s one of the best guards in football.”

Jackson reported the Dolphins had discussions with Schwartz, but while there is interest between the two parties, Miami wants to shop around for other options at guard.

Schwartz played only 13 games in two years for the Giants, and part of that is because he's getting older, as he told Christine Skopec of CheatSheet.com.

"When you’re young and get banged up, you can bounce back from it so much faster," the 29-year-old said. "I remember I had sprained ankles in football and doctors saying you need to take off X amount of time, and I’d just play anyways."

The Dolphins list Dallas Thomas and Billy Turner (combined four years of experience) as their starting guards, with Shelley Smith and Jamil Douglas as the backups. Miami does need depth, and Schwartz could be a stopgap option should one of the young guards fall on the depth chart or suffer an injury.
