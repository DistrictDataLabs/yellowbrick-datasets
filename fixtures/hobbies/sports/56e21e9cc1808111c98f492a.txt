Kristaps Porzingis continues to cement himself as a legend.

On Thursday, New York Knicks center Kevin Seraphin captured the Latvian rookie sinking a mammoth shot from well beyond the backboard.

After launching, Porzingis channeled his inner Stephen Curry. He turned and sat down before the ball even found the bottom of the net.

One word: Zing.
