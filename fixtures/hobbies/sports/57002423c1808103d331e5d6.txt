British eventer William Fox-Pitt said he felt "lucky" to be back in competition following his serious accident in France last year. 

The 47-year-old, Britain's most successful rider with 20 major championship medals, was placed in an induced coma after a fall in October.

He returned to action at the Burnham Market International Horse Trials.

"It's great to be here - it's been a long winter and I had two good rounds so I've had a very happy day," he said.

Fox-Pitt was injured at the World Young Horse Championships in Lion-D'Angers on 17 October and spent a month in hospital.

On his comeback he rode experienced horses Cool Mountain and Parklane Hawk.

"I'm very lucky to be here," he told BBC Sport. "My team have worked hard to get the horses ready.

"Luckily it felt very normal. I was riding two horses I know very well. They're both 16-year-olds and I've had them for years. But I've lost considerable fitness through my accident, though it's coming back and it's great to be feeling normal again."

Asked about his plans for Olympic year, he added: "I've got a very good horse in Chilly Morning that I am hoping to take to Rio. I had him entered here but decided to leave him at home. He's not in any hurry - he can go next weekend.

"It feels very good but who knows what will happen?"
