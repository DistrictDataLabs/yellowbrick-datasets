'Potential For a Breakup' Between Grizzlies and Conley

Monday, April 18

CBSSports.com's Ken Berger reported the buzz on Conley's future April 13, citing sources with knowledge of the situation.

Kevin Lipe of the Memphis Flyer weighed in on the report, wondering who would suspect Conley is likely leaving the team:

Memphis selected the 28-year-old fourth overall in the 2007 draft, and Conley has spent his entire NBA career with the franchise. His 2015-16 campaign was cut short due to left Achilles tendinitis.

With an impressive assist-to-turnover ratio of 5.6-2.0, Conley has established himself as a proficient distributor and has always had exceptional agility and lateral quickness. He's tough to guard off the dribble, and he's also a stellar perimeter defender—an integral part of the Grizzlies' defensive identity.

Injuries devastated Memphis this season, yet it still qualified for the playoffs despite losing Conley and star big man Marc Gasol among others for extensive periods of time. But, the possibility of losing Conley for good reportedly looms.

Gasol signed a max, five-year contract last offseason, so at least the Grizzlies can build around him in the event Conley decides to flee. The future of the backcourt is a big issue, though, because Memphis doesn't really have a proven offensive commodity at either guard position.

Point guard Xavier Munford performed rather well in his first taste of NBA action this season, but the Grizzlies' current backcourt is a patchwork platoon. It needs a leader like Conley for Memphis to remain among the West's playoff contenders.
