Stephen Curry and the Golden State Warriors (70-9) are on the road to take on Zach Randolph and the Memphis Grizzlies (42-37) Saturday at the FedEx Forum.

The Warriors, who need to win their last three games to break the 1995-96 Chicago Bulls' record of regular-season 72 wins, have outscored the Grizzlies by 66 points in two meetings.

 

Tipoff: 8 p.m. ET

Coverage: ESPN

Injuries (per CBS Sports): Andrew Bogut, GSW (out, rest); Kevon Looney, GSW (game-time decision, hip); Jordan Adams, MEM (out, knee); Mike Conley, MEM (out, Achilles); Brandan Wright, MEM (out, knee); Marc Gasol, MEM (out, foot)

 

Keys to the Game

The Warriors defense will have to be stout inside against Randolph, who's averaging 19.4 points and 7.9 rebounds since returning from injury on March 19.

The Grizzlies, meanwhile, have to find some way to frustrate Curry. With Tony Allen out (per NBATV's Jared Greenberg), some of the responsibility may fall to Lance Stephenson.
