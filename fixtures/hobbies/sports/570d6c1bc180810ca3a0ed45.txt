The NFL reportedly denied Josh Gordon's petition for reinstatement Tuesday, per Cleveland.com's Mary Kay Cabot and NFL Media's Albert Breer. According to Breer, the Cleveland Browns wide receiver can reapply on Aug. 1. 

The development comes a day after Fox Sports' Mike Garafolo reported Gordon failed a drug test in March. Both of his "A" and "B" samples reportedly tested positive for marijuana and dilute, and despite the fact the amount of marijuana didn't meet the required threshold, having a diluted sample equates to testing positive.
