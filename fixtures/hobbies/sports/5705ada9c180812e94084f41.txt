The Cincinnati Bengals have re-signed many key free agents this offseason, but they just lost one. 

ESPN's Adam Schefter reported star safety Reggie Nelson agreed to terms with the Oakland Raiders on a two-year contract. Ian Rapoport of the NFL Network also reported the news. 

Despite the fact Nelson is 32 years old, his 2015 season showed he has plenty of good football left in him. He tied the NFL lead with eight interceptions and had 14 passes defensed in addition to racking up 77 total tackles.

With his big hitting ability and tremendous ball skills, Nelson is a complete player who was a huge reason why the Bengals ranked second in scoring defense. Now there's a hole in Cincinnati's secondary alongside safety George Iloka.

Meanwhile, Oakland welcomes Nelson to a secondary that has been suspect in recent years.

One of the few bright spots on the back end last year was Charles Woodson, who retired following the 2015 campaign. Nelson will attempt to fill that void.

With another marquee free agent in cornerback Sean Smith—from the AFC West rival Kansas City Chiefs, no less—Oakland's defensive backfield figures to be formidable in 2016 and beyond.

One silver lining about Nelson's departure is Cincinnati should have the means necessary to re-sign the rest of its key defensive backs. The Bengals could then address Nelson's position in the draft.

Expectations will continue to be high for the Bengals as they try to snap a five-year streak of one-and-done playoff appearances. The loss of such a crucial player won't reduce the immense pressure on Cincinnati to win.
