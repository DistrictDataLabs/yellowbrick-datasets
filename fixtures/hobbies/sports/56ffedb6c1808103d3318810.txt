La Liga returns after the international break with one of the biggest fixtures of the season, El Clasico, as Barcelona host Real Madrid at the Camp Nou.

Barca are clear at the top by nine points and on course to retain their title, but they know a win on Saturday would end any lingering hopes their great rivals retained of a comeback.

Real are third, a further point back from Atletico Madrid, and are facing the prospect of not only a trophyless season but having the double done over them by Barca—it's must-win for Real, for pride as much as professionalism.

The game kicks off at 7:30 p.m. BST (2:30 p.m. ET), and our coverage starts shortly beforehand.
