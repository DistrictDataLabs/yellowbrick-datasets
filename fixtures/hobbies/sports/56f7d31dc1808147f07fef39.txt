India batsman Virat Kohli says he is ready for the challenge posed by Australia in the winner-takes-all World Twenty20 match on Sunday.

The victors in Mohali will advance to the semi-finals, while the losers will go out.

"We all know Australia are a very strong side," said 27-year-old right-hander Kohli.

"They play with a lot of passion and I believe in playing the same way so I like that challenge."

During a one-day international against Australia in Melbourne earlier this year, Kohli made a century and was involved in an argument with all-rounder James Faulkner that was picked up by the on-field microphones.

"You're wasting your energy," said Kohli. "There's no point. I've smashed you all my life. Just go and bowl."

Now, Kohli is ready for another verbal battle and insists it will motivate him more.

"If I get into a little bit of debate with anyone, and if I have to take a certain stand, that doesn't necessarily put me off my game," he said.

"If anything, that motivates me more."

Australia are currently ranked number one in Test cricket and are the reigning 50-over World Cup champions, but have never won the World T20.

All-rounder Glenn Maxwell said they will have to deal with India's spinners if they are to reach the semi-finals for the third time.

"If we negate their spinners and are still quite aggressive against them and find a way, I'm sure that will go a long way to winning us the game," said Maxwell.

"The key to playing spin is being positive so hopefully we can do that."
