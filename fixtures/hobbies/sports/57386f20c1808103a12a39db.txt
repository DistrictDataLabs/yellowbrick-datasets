Everton striker Oumar Niasse was arrested by Greater Manchester Police amid allegations of assault. 

As the BBC reported, authorities were called to a property in Salford, Greater Manchester, at 12:55 a.m. BST on Friday, and the Senegal international was taken into custody. The 26-year-old was subsequently bailed.

A spokesperson for Everton said the club "condemns unreservedly any form of abuse," and they "understand an investigation is underway to establish the facts."

Niasse signed for the Toffees during the midseason transfer window for £13.5 million, the third-highest fee paid for a player in the club's history, from Lokomotiv Moscow. However, the forward has endured an underwhelming spell at Goodison Park.

A wrist injury kept him sidelined initially, before he eventually made his debut for the club against Bournemouth in the FA Cup. Niasse has made sporadic appearances since and hasn't scored for the Toffees.
