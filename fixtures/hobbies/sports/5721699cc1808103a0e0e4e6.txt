The final participant in the second round of the Stanley Cup playoffs will be determined on Wednesday at 10 p.m. ET as the Nashville Predators visit the Anaheim Ducks in Game 7 of their Western Conference first-round series. 

The Predators forced the first Game 7 in franchise history on Monday with a 3-1 win at Bridgestone Arena. 

Anaheim returns home for the final game of the best-of-seven series, but that isn't necessarily a good thing. The Ducks have a poor recent history in elimination games, and they dropped the first two games of the series at the Honda Center. 

Our live coverage of Game 7 between the Predators and Ducks begins 10 minutes before the puck drops.
