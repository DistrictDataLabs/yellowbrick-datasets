Heather Watson lost 6-1 6-3 to 13th seed Svetlana Kuznetsova as Britain's interest in the French Open women's singles ended in the second round.

Watson's serve was broken four times as the world number 56 lost the first set in 30 minutes to the 2009 champion.

The 24-year-old Briton, who has never made the third round of the French Open in six attempts, tested the Russian in a much closer second set.

But Kuznetsova proved too strong and went on to secure victory.

British number one Johanna Konta, Laura Robson and Naomi Broady all lost in the first round in Paris.

Andy Murray, Kyle Edmund and Aljaz Bedene are all in the second round of the men's singles, with Murray and Edmund in action later and Bedene playing on Thursday.

Elsewhere in the women's singles, Russian 2014 Roland Garros finalist Simona Halep beat Zarina Diyas of Kazakhstan 7-6 6-2 to reach the third round.

Czech Petra Kvitova, the two-time Wimbledon champion, also progressed with a 6-4 6-1 victory over Hsieh Su-Wei of Chinese Taipei.
