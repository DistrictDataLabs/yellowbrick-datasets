Late in the NCAA tournament game between the seventh-seeded Wisconsin Badgers and the No. 2 Xavier Musketeers, Bronson Koenig hit two 3-pointers -- including one at the buzzer -- to send the team from Madison to the Sweet 16.

A certain former Badger enjoyed the moment.

Yes, that's Frank Kaminsky, who led Wisconsin to the national title game a season ago (he now plays for the Charlotte Hornets).

He wasn't alone, as far as Wisconsin-tied athletes are concerned:

Dekker, now with the Houston Rockets, was one of Kaminsky's teammates during last season's run. Seattle Seahawks star Wilson, of course, played one year at Wisconsin. And Rodgers? He didn't attend Wisconsin -- he played at California -- but the Green Bay Packers quarterback has embraced the biggest college team in his home state, and doesn't care what you think about that.
