The Miami Dolphins are adding some more depth to their defensive line.

NFL Media Insider Ian Rapoport reported Friday that defensive end Jason Jones is headed to Miami to sign a deal with the Dolphins, according to a source with knowledge of the situation.

Jones gives the Dolphins another option on the edge with Cameron Wake working his way back from a torn Achilles tendon. Jones started 31 of 32 games for the Lions over the past two season, collecting 9.5 sacks in that time. He'll turn 30 later this month and is currently recovering from offseason knee surgery. Jones has already come back from a torn patellar tendon suffered early in the 2013 season.

Jones and the Dolphins had been in talks for weeks, according to reports, making Friday's news somewhat expected. Jones also met with the Cowboys during his extended period of free agency.
