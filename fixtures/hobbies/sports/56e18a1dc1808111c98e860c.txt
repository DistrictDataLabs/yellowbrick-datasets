Sunderland are willing to refund supporters who purchased kits bearing Adam Johnson's name following the winger's conviction, reported Jerry Lawton of the Daily Star (h/t Euan McLelland of MailOnline).

The 28-year-old Johnson was sacked by the Premier League club in February and found guilty of sexual activity with a 15-year-old girl last week, an offence for which he faces four to 10 years in prison, per the BBC.

And now Sunderland are prepared to fork out up to £68 refunds to fans who had the midfielder's name printed on the back of their replica shirt.

A staff member at the club shop told Lawton: "We'll give you a refund or replace the shirt if you have Johnson on the back and it is the current strip."
