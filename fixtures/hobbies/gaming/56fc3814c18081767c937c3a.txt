Earlier today, rumors that the next Call of Duty is bringing the franchise back to space with heavy sci-fi themes hit. While this represents an even further departure from the series' more traditional roots in World War II and modern combat, it's a part of the franchise's continued trend toward futuristic settings, which started with Black Ops II and Advanced Warfare. 

I've laid out my choices for where I'd like to see the Call of Duty franchise go from here, but among those the ones that I favor the most are distant future, Vietnam War, and a return to the series' roots with World War II. A game set in space would certainly hint at a more distant future, but how far would Activision and its development studios assigned to the Call of Duty franchise want to push it?

Where would you like to see the Call of Duty franchise go from here? Do you like the future-facing state of the franchise or would you prefer to return to the slower, historically-based settings? Are you a fan of the faster-paced multiplayer that relies heavily on sci-fi and fantasy elements, or do you miss the days of controlling a standard soldier?
