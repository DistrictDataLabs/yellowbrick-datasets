Shadow Moses, a fan-developed remake of Metal Gear Solid in Unreal Engine 4, has been canceled. Its developer announced on the game's Facebook page that it would cease production "for reasons beyond our control."

The developer declined to elaborate further. Just last month, a short video on the Shadow Moses Facebook page hinted that a "huge announcement" would be coming on March 14.

The Shadow Moses team revealed the high-definition remake of Metal Gear Solid in October 2015. The gaming community caught wind of the project when the developer released a teaser trailer in January, showing off iconic locations from the 1998 PlayStation game.

After the video racked up more than 100,000 views, lead developer Airam Hernandez clarified on Facebook that Konami owns the rights to the Metal Gear Solid franchise and thus Shadow Moses would require the company's blessing "sooner or later."

Whether Konami is behind Shadow Moses' sudden cancelation is not yet known. We've reached out to both the Shadow Moses team and Konami for comment and will update when we receive it.
