LittleBigPlanet 3 developer Sumo Digital has brought in Karl Hilton, formerly MD of Crytek UK, to head up its new Nottingham studio. 

The veteran director oversaw the successful development of Crysis 2 and 3 while at Crytek, and before that was a founding member and director at Free Radical. 

Hilton has been made Studio Director of Sumo's second UK studio, which will work in conjunction with the developer's Sheffield and India offices on a number of upcoming projects. 

Sumo CEO, Carl Cavers, has hinted at what those upcoming projects might entail, explaining the Nottingham studio will allow the developer to "explore new opportunities across consoles, PC, mobile, and VR."
