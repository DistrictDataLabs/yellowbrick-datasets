Warner Bros.' upcoming The Flash movie no longer has a director. Seth Grahame-Smith is exiting the DC Comics movie, citing "creative differences," sources told The Hollywood Reporter.

The Flash would have been Grahame-Smith's directorial debut. He wrote the movies Pride & Prejudice & Zombies and Abraham Lincoln, Vampire Hunter.

Though Grahame-Smith has left The Flash, Warner Bros. is reportedly keeping his script, which he developed after The Lego Movie's Phil Lord and Christopher Miller got it started.

The Flash is scheduled to come to theaters on March 3, 2018, though it is unclear if Grahame-Smith exiting the project will result in a delay. Actor Ezra Miller will play The Flash AKA Barry Allen; he also plays the speedy superhero in the CW show.

In November 2015, it was confirmed that the Flash movie will have no connection to the TV show.
