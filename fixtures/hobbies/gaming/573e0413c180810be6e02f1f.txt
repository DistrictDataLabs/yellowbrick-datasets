Sony and developer Polyphony Digital have announced a release date for the competition-focused GT Sport, as well as the game's pre-order bonuses and special edition.

The PS4 game comes out on November 15, and its multiplayer focus encompasses two championship series: one where you race for your country, and the other your manufacturer.

You can now pre-order the title, and depending on where you go, you'll get different goodies (click the PS Blog link below for more information).
