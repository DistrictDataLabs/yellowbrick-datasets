Like AMC's post-Walking Dead talkshow series, The Talking Dead, HBO has a new show that will air on Mondays following the newest episode of Game of Thrones called After the Thrones.

Hosted by The Ringer's Andy Greenwald (formerly of Grantland) and Chris Ryan, After the Thrones breaks down what fans of the show saw the night before. Greenwald and Ryan have both made names for themselves over the years for their intelligent approach to pop culture coverage, with Greenwald becoming one of the most admired and read television critics in the country.

The show will also aim to provide additional context for non-readers of the book series, going into more detailed character pasts and how that will influence the show. The sixth season of the show, however, does mark the first season that the show will outpace the books. Author George R.R. Martin has been rushing to release the newest installment in his A Song of Ice and Fire series to try and catch up.

After the Thrones airs every Monday at 1:15 a.m. ET. The show will also be available on HBO Go and HBO Now for those who subscribe to the network's stand-alone streaming service.
