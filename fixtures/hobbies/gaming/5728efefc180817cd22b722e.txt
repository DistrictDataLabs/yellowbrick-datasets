If you don't pay attention to the PC/console world, chances are you've missed out on 2K's latest blockbuster release, Battleborn. The easiest way to describe it is if you took Borderlands, added some elements which almost feel MOBA-like, mixed in a bunch of different characters kind of like Blizzard's Overwatch, and gave all of them their own guns and abilities. Here's the launch trailer which gives you an idea of how that all goes together:

Well, the mobile companion game launched this morning as well. It's called Battleborn Tap [Free] and it somewhat predictably distills what 2K is aiming for in Battleborn into a super-simple party based tap to attack kind of game. Here's what it looks like in motion:

It seems like the main reason to play Battleborn Tap is to unlock rewards in Battleborn proper. For instance, just by downloading the game and linking your 2K SHiFT account you'll be able to get a fancy schmancy Orendi skin. Play a bit longer, and you'll get other exclusive rewards for the full version of the game. I'm always a sucker for these kind of exclusive skin things, so, I'll be tappin' away today.
