You'll soon be able to legitimately mod Sega Mega Drive classics via Steam, the former platform has announced.

Sega's Mega Drive Classics Hub will feature Steam Workshop support and a library of Mega Drive games accessible via a virtual bedroom interface when it launches on 28th April.

The bedroom features a dynamic day and night light cycle. No idea why.

Even if you aren't excited by the idea of modding, it's worth noting that all existing Mega Drive Steam games will be updated with full controller and keyboard support plus the option to save at any time. Handy!

See the new hub in action around the 1:00 mark below:
