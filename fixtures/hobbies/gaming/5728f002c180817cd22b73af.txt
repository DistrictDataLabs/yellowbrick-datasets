An angel is trapped inside of a human vessel, who in turn is trapped in a prison filled with demons, in Seraph, a sidescrolling action game now out on Steam Early Access. If the vessel dies, so does she, so the angel will aim all of the vessel's shots. The vessel just has to pull the trigger and keep from getting hurt using an array of acrobatic moves as she blasts her monstrous opponents.

The more successful you are at Seraph, the harder its enemies get, though, so players will find themselves constantly challenged in the procedurally-generated levels. The game also features Twitch integration that will let viewers add positive or negative modifiers, so if the game seems too hard or easy, maybe some strangers on the internet will help you out. Maybe. Probably not, but maybe.
