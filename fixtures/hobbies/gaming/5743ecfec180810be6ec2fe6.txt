About a week ago, we shared part of an interview that was conducted by Nintendo Dream with Yugo Hayashi and Shigeru Miyamoto, who led development of Star Fox Zero. Part one dealt with the inspiration behind many of the game's mechanics, along with a discussion of the highly divisive control scheme. Now, Nintendo has gone ahead and translated the second part of the interview, delving deeper into the gameplay.

The first part starts off by reviewing the vehicles and all of the different forms they can take, highlighting how the different forms of each vehicle broaden the scope and variety of the gameplay far beyond that of previous games. Also – as it would happen – the Retro Walker that you obtain by scanning the Fox amiibo is actually the original model that was set to feature in the never-released Star Fox 2.

Moving on from there, they discuss the Zoness stage that featured the Gyrowing, stating that it was included to break up gameplay a bit and to have an "Adventure" stage present. Next, they discuss Miyamoto's involvement in the game, which was essentially that of director. Miyamoto goes on to say that he hasn't actually been credited as a director on a game since Super Mario 64, and that the next closest game where he had as much influence was The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time.

The whole thing can be found here; it makes for quite a fascinating read.

What do you think? Did you appreciate all the vehicle transformations? Can you believe it's been two decades since Miyamoto last directed a game officially? Drop us a comment in the section below.
