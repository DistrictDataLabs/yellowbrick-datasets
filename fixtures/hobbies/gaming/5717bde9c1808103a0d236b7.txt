After charming the App Store with its quirky theme and great art, 

 is now available on Android, too, and I suggest you go pick it up. If you don't know anything about the game, 

 is the digital version of the Kickstarter-darling card game that broke many records and landed on many tables. In the game, you try to avoid finding yourself holding an Exploding Kitten card while lacking a Defuse card. If that happens, well, the poor kitty gets it. Wrong as the theme may sound (especially for a cat lover like myself), the game is really fun to play.

As I mentioned in my review of the iOS version (spoiler: I really liked it), the game hits the right balance between being casual and having enough complexity to keep it interesting. And, more importantly, the art and sound effects are top notch and will keep you smiling and laughing throughout. The game offers local and online multiplayer for 2-5 players and will offer hours of fun and multiple instances of ruined friendships. Exploding Kittens costs $1.99, and you can get it here.
