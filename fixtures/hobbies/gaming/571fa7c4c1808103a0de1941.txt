The latest episode of Hitman launches today, transporting players and Agent 47 to the sun-drenched beaches of Sapienza, Italy. This gorgeous level features picturesque alleyways, coastal walks, popular fishing destinations, a gelateria and er, a secret laboratory, but this is no holiday. In the level's first mission, World of Tomorrow, Agent 47 is tasked with taking out not one but two targets and destroying their potentially deadly research - no small feat when their mansion is essentially a seaside fortress.

But, being good sports, Johnny, Ian and myself decided to test our skills and see if we couldn't come up with three completely different outcomes. Well, they're certainly that. Enjoy the gelato guys, I'll send you a postcard from my speedboat.
