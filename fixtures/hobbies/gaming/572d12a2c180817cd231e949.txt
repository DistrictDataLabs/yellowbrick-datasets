NBA Live 16, the most recent basketball game from EA Sports, will be available to EA Access subscribers in The Vault starting May 25, according to the EA Access Twitter account.

Developed by EA Tiburon, NBA Live 16 was originally released last September on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One to a lukewarm reception. Its face scanning app, at least, was actually pretty good.

The impending debut of NBA Live 16 on EA Access will mean that all of EA's 2015 sports games are available free to subscribers. EA's latest sports title is EA Sports UFC 2, which launched less than two months ago.

EA Access, which is available exclusively on Xbox One, costs $4.99 a month or $24.99 a year. NBA Live 16 will be the 21st game to be added to The Vault, following FIFA 16 last month and Rory McIlroy PGA Tour next week.
