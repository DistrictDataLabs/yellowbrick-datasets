Updates to the Prey 2 and Prey 3 domains have sparked speculation that Bethesda may reintroduce the game at E3 2016 in June.

Links to both websites (Prey 2.com, Prey 3.com) now redirect to a Facebook page that blocks viewers from seeing content on the page. This has led some to posit that the page will become active when a new game is announced.

Publisher Bethesda, however, has not shown any indication of bringing the series back since its cancellation.

Prey 2 was officially announced in 2011 with Human Head Studios attached as its developer. The project suffered multiple issues and fell into limbo for an extended period.

In August 2013, it was suggested that Bethesda had handed development duties to Arkane Austin, though this was not officially confirmed. In October of the following year, Bethesda announced that Prey 2 had been cancelled.

"It was a game we believed in, but we never felt that it got to where it needed to be--we never saw a path to success if we finished it," said VP of PR and marketing Pete Hines.

Hines added, however, that the Prey franchise may not be dormant forever.

"It's a franchise we still believe we can do something with--we just need to see what that something is," he said.

Bethesda is scheduled to host an E3 briefing on June 12. It did not confirm what will be shown at the event, but a teaser image contained references to the Fallout, Dishonored, and Elder Scrolls franchises, among others.

Arkane's Lyon, France-based studio, meanwhile, is working on Dishonored 2, which has a confirmed release date of November 11. For more on the game, read our recent Dishonored 2 preview and interview with its developer.
