This week, PlayStation Store brings LEGO games and movies to the Franchise Sale series. Starting now and lasting through Monday, April 18, select LEGO games and movies are available for up to 75% off. PlayStation Plus members save up to an additional 15%.


Pick up LEGO games inspired by franchises including Jurassic Park, Marvel’s Avengers and Harry Potter all at reduced prices on PlayStation Store.


Games



The LEGO franchise extends beyond games to movies as well, so it is only fitting that this week’s Franchise Sale features LEGO movies too. Don’t wait to pick up these films — these deals will be heading back to the toy box soon!


Movies



Check back next Tuesday for the final week of the Franchise Sale series, featuring Grand Theft Auto and Fast & Furious*.

*Fast & Furious movies discounted in the U.S. only.
