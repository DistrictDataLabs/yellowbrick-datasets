If the challenge of simply getting through the gruelling levels of Mutant Mudds Super Challenge isn't enough for you there are a range of hidden characters to track down. Today we have the official reveal of the Shovel Knight character.

Jools Watsham, creator of the game, today drew back the curtain on how exactly to find Shovel Knight. Watsham is also offering special Mutant Mudds posters for lucky winners who tweet a selfie with Shovel Knight and the tag #MutantMuddsSuperChallenge.

Once you have found the character, revealed in the video here, you can then select him to play through Mutant Mudds Super Challenge to your heart's content. (No shovel attacks spotted yet though.)
