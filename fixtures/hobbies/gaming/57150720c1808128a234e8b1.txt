Earlier this year, GameStop (Disclosure: GameStop is Game Informerâ€™s parent company) and Insomniac announced a partnership to publish Song of the Deep. Today the retailer revealed deals with three more studios as part of its GameTrust initiative.

GameStop will be publishing games from Tequila Works (Deadlight, Rime), Ready at Dawn (The Order: 1886), and Frozenbyte (Trine). No specific titles have been announced, however two of these developers have projects in progress of which we are aware.

Frozenbyte just announced that its PC stealth-action game Shadwen is also coming to PlayStation 4. Tequila Works has long been working on Rime, and recently reacquired the rights from Sony. Whether these are the titles GameStop is involved in is as yet unclear.

GameStop says it is not part of the creative process in its role as publisher. Rather it says it is leveraging retail space and distribution.
