Now that PC Fallout 4 players have access to mods and the big Far Harbor DLC has a launch date, Bethesda wants console players to know that a promise will soon be fulfilled. No specific dates have been announced, but player shouldn’t have too long to wait for mods.

According to a note on Twitter, Bethesda says that it is shifting gears to focus on Xbox One mods. Console support will kick off on Microsoft’s console after Far Harbor’s launch on May 19th. Given previous promises of Xbox One mod beta launching in May, that narrows it down to a comfortable 11-day period (assuming things are still on track). PS4 mod support should arrive in June.
