Battleborn developer Gearbox Software has outlined the post-launch content plans for the May 3 title, including free content, a season pass, and more.

Five DLC packs will be available after launch (dates unspecified), each with a new story operation (PvE side stories) and exclusive skins and taunts. Each pack can be bought separately for $4.99 or all together in a season pass for $19.99.

The season pass is included in the game's deluxe digital edition, which also throws in some extra cosmetic customizations all for $74.99.

More cosmetic options will be sold in-game as microtransactions (price TBA), but they will not affect gameplay.

Finally, Gearbox has announced it will also be supporting the game via free updates consisting of five new characters, maps, balance tweaks, community features, modes, and more.

Recently the developer announced that the game has gone gold, and that a beta is forthcoming.

Our TakeGiven Battleborn's co-op/competitive multiplayer focus, it's good that the maps, modes, and characters are being given away for free while the side-story pieces are what's behind the paid wall.
