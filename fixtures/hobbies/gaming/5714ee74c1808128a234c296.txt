The Unspoken is an upcoming VR title from Insomniac exclusively for Oculus Rift and its touch controllers. 

The first-person spell-casting multiplayer game has players fight against one another in an urban, magical world. Using a wide range of spells, such as summoning fireballs and shields, you cunningly try to defeat your opponent in a one on one fight.





The Unspoken will release during Holiday 2016.
