Minecraft and its Telltale-developed spinoff, Minecraft: Story Mode, are united at last. Microsoft has announced that a pack of skins based on the episodic series are now available on a number of platforms.

The skin pack is available for the Windows 10 beta, the Pocket Edition for iOS, Google Play, and Windows phone, and the console edition on Xbox One, Xbox 360, PlayStation 4, and Playstation 3. It’s free for the first week. After that, it’s $2.99.

If you miss the window, you’ll still be able to play with six different versions of Jesse for free. There’s also a free Story Mode-themed arena map.
