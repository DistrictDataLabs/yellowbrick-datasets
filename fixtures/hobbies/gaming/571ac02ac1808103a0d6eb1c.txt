Ark: Survival Evolved has reached new heights in terms of sales and is doubling down on mod content. Developer Studio Wildcard today announced that the game has now sold 1 million copies on Xbox One and 4 million units on PC. As for the modding news, a new mod program for the dinosaur game has launched, through which users can submit mods that could eventually be considered to be added to the Xbox One and PC versions of the title.

The first of these mods, a map called The Center, will come out in May. According to Studio Wildcard, this map is massive--it will "more than double" the content of the base game. Additionally, another mod called Primitive Plus will come out in the summer. Note that these mods are already playable on PC, but have never before been released on Xbox One. Check out the maps in action in the video below:

Studio Wildcard also confirmed today that Ark's full release is scheduled for holiday 2016 across Xbox One, PC, and PlayStation 4. Previously, the game was due out in the summer.

"Ark's success has increased our content goals and Early Access players have helped us raise our ambitions with their invaluable feedback," Studio Wildcard co-founder Jesse Rapczak said in a statement. "When we first announced, we said 70 dinos, now we'll have over 100. We never anticipated adding modding, local multiplayer, split screen, or numerous other upcoming features. The game at launch will be far more robust than originally conceived, but it takes a little extra time to wrap it all up."

The Xbox One edition of Ark is available through the console's Game Preview program, while the PC edition can be found on Steam Early Access.

In other news about Ark, the free-to-play spinoff Ark: Survival of the Fittest is coming to PS4 this summer. It's already available on PC, though an Xbox One version of the game has not been announced.

Additionally, Studio Wildcard recently settled a lawsuit with Dungeon Defenders developer Trendy for a reported $40 million.
