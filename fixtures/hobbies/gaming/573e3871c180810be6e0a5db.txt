Blizzard has revealed when servers will go online for Overwatch next week, and it's perhaps a bit earlier than you may have expected.

As with the open beta, the servers are scheduled to go up at the same time around the world: 12 AM BST on Tuesday, May 24, which translates to 4 PM PDT / 7 PM EDT on Monday, May 23. A full schedule follows at the bottom of this post.

We already knew physical copies would be available for purchase on Monday in order to ensure players could be ready for launch on Tuesday. But with this being a simultaneous global launch, that means those in the Western Hemisphere can start playing on Monday.

Instructions for how to install the game ahead of time are detailed on Blizzard's blog. It's all pretty standard fare, though if you purchase a physical PC version, you'll still need to download the Battle.net desktop app. You'll then install the game through there after redeeming your key on the Battle.net website. Or, if you still have the game installed from the beta, the app will simply download an update once it's ready.

Blizzard says Overwatch should be available for preloading on PC by tomorrow, May 20. You can already preload on Xbox One, but there's no mention about the PS4 version.

If you played the beta, you'll already be familiar with everything coming at launch. Blizzard has plans to add a competitive mode that was cut, as well as other, as-of-yet unannounced content.
