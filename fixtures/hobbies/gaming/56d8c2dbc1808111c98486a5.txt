During today's Nintendo Direct broadcast it was confirmed that Kirby is getting another outing on 3DS in the shape of Kirby: Planet Robobot.

The title retains the 2.5D look of Kirby: Triple Deluxe, but adds mechs to the mix. It also comes with a special Team Kirby Clash mode:

Invaders have mechanized Dream Land. To restore his home to its original form, Kirby must use their technology against them with the new Robobot Armor. The Robobot Armor can even destroy a variety of obstacles in his way.

The Team Kirby Clash mode lets up to four players join forces to battle against powerful bosses. Players select one of four roles, and participate in a co-op quest to defeat a boss while supporting their team. Completing a quest earns experience points to level-up and grow more powerful.

The game will come with amiibo support, and four new Kirby figures will appear alongside it at launch:

The game is compatible with a large variety of amiibo figures, and some give Kirby character-specific abilities. A new series of Kirby amiibo figures that includes Kirby, King Dedede, Meta Knight and Waddle Dee gives Kirby attributes specific to each character. Tapping the Kirby figure is the only way to get the UFO ability.

The game and new amiibo figures launch June 10th in North America and Europe.
