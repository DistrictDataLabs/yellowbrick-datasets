Beta tests can be an important step in the video game development process since it provides developers with bug detection as well as feedback on design and operational readiness in a real world environment. It also provides gamers an opportunity to test and experience these titles firsthand before their official release date. Due to the number of released and upcoming betas that have been announced, I wanted to share a consolidated list of titles with links where you can download/pre-download the beta or visit the official website for more information.
