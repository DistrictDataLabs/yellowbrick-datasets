Monster Hunter X has finally been announced for North America with Monster Hunter Generations for 3DS. Slaying gargantuan beasts and reassembling their body parts into armor and weapons has served the series well, and Generations continues this trend with new features and a release window. 

Monster Hunter is a huge cultural and financial juggernaut in Japan, and Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate proved to be a commercial and critical success in America. Monster Hunter X released in November of last year in Japan, and fans have been patiently awaiting its announcement for the West.

Monster Hunter Generations introduces a slew of new monsters, abilities, and a revamped armor upgrade system in addition to other changes. The clip shown during the Nintendo Direct featured four colossal flagship monsters that seem to be tent poles in the plot. 

If you have Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate save data on your 3DS SD card, then you will get bonus content in Monster Hunter Generations. There will also be a Fire Emblem crossover with downloadable Marth costumes. Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate had myriad crossovers including Zelda, Mega Man, and Animal Crossing. 

Monster Hunter Generations is slated for a summer 2016 release on Nintendo 3DS. For more Monster Hunter coverage, click here.
