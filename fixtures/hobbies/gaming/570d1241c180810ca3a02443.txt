The world of Fallout 4's post-apocalyptic Boston continues to grow today with the release of the game's second expansion, Wasteland Workshop.

It's out now on Xbox One, PlayStation 4, ,and PC, priced at $5. In Asia, however, console players will need to wait until April 19 to pick up the DLC, Bethesda explained.

As announced previously, Wasteland Workshop lets players design cages for all manner of creatures, including raiders and Deathclaws. "Tame them or have them face off in battle, even against your fellow settlers," reads a line from its description. "The Wasteland Workshop also includes a suite of new design options for your settlements like nixie tube lighting, letter kits, taxidermy, and more."

Fallout 4's first expansion was March's robot-themed Automatron, while Bethesda will release the next add-on, Far Harbor, in May. This content is set in a version of Maine's famous Bar Harbor and represents the largest landmass Bethesda has ever made for a DLC release.

You can get all three expansions--as well future add-ons coming in 2016 that have not been announced yet--for $50 through the Season Pass. In other Fallout 4 news, the beta for the PC Creation Kit is expanding.
