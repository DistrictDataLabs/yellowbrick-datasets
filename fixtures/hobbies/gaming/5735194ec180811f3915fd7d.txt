After one mediocre season, ABC has decided to pull the plug on The Muppets, according to The Hollywood Reporter.

The show was rushed to series after the pilot garnered quite a bit of attention at last year's upfront television conference, and even debuted to pretty high ratings despite lukewarm critical reviews. By the time the show entered its second half of the season following the winter break, however, it had dropped significantly in the ratings; creative control over the project had been lost.

Co-created by Bill Prady and Bob Kushell, The Muppets was supposed to be one of the network's hit new shows, but finished with a 1.9 rating and a less-than-stellar amount of weekly of viewers.

The Muppets joins Castle and Marvel's Agent Carter in getting cut from ABC's lineup today.
