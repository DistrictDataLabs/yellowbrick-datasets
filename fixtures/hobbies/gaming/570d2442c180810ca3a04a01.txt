Now that we know the release date of Square Enix’s next Star Ocean game, it’s time to learn more about the game. The second “Star Log” livestream is happening this afternoon, during which we’ll meet more of the cast.

Today’s stream will also give us more details about the battle system. The team will be answering questions live and has promised that there will be surprises, too.

You can catch the stream on Square Enix’s Twitch channel today at 4 p.m. Pacific / 7 p.m. Eastern. Star Ocean: Integrity and Faithlessness arrives on June 28 for PlayStation 4.

 

Our TakeFollowing the Final Fantasy XV Active Time Report model is a smart move for bigger, more complex games. This allows Square Enix to show different aspects in a measured fashion, interact with fans, and receive feedback along the way.
