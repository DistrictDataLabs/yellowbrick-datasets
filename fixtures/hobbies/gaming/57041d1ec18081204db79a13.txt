Hi there, friends! It's time once again for the RPG Reload Podcast, where Eric, Andy, and I discuss all kinds of things RPG and otherwise. First of all, I have to apologize. This was recorded at the height of a nasty cold I had, and I sound exactly how I felt. I hope to be more perky next month. Our featured game this time around is Hunters Episode One [$4.99 / $4.99 (HD)], which isn't exactly a massive epic. That leaves us with lots of time to talk about other things, and gosh, do we ever. I'd say my favorite part of this episode is hearing about Eric's trip to Blizzard to check out the latest Hearthstone [Free] info. I personally don't know much about the game past playing it a few times here and there, but Eric and Andy are scholarly enough to discuss the topic thoroughly.

In addition to our excellent theme song by Sweet Diss And The Comebacks, we've got two pieces of music on this episode. During the break, it's Encounter With The Seven Heroes from Romancing SaGa 2's soundtrack, composed by Kenji Ito. We close out the show with the Theme Of Fire Emblem from the Japan-only Fire Emblem: Mystery Of The Emblem, composed by Yuka Tsujiyoko. That might seem weird for an iOS RPG podcast, but we talk a lot about Fire Emblem in this episode. These things happen.

In the next episode, we'll be talking about Crescent Moon's Ravensword: Shadowlands [$6.99], so make sure to set aside a good chunk of time if you want to play along with us! Remember, if you have any questions related to that game or any other RPG, or just want to ask us anything, drop an email to rpgreloadpodcast@gmail.com. On behalf of Eric, Andy, and myself, I hope you all enjoy this month's episode. Thanks for listening!
