It's not just Rocket League that's getting DLC based on the upcoming Warner Bros. movie Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. Warner Bros. Interactive today released a new update for the mobile version of fighting game Injustice: Gods Among Us that brings content based on the movie to the title.

Some of the content available with today's update includes Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman characters inspired by how they look in the movie. These characters, and some new gear, can be unlocked for Injustice's challenge mode, while players can also purchase them for real-world money.

The characters will be available in Injustice until April 13.

Also new to Injustice on mobile today is the Dawn of Justice Gold Booster Pack, which gives you the chance to get the Batman character for the main game. On top of that, the Dawn of Justice "Gear Locker" is now available to buy--it contains things like Batman's Cowl, Clark Kent's Glasses, and Wonder Woman's Golden Lariat.

All of this content is designed to match how it looks in the movie.

In addition to the Dawn of Justice content, today's Injustice update adds new characters from the DC Comics universe such as villains Black Adam and Sinestro.

The update is out now for iOS devices, with an Android release to follow. Like the console version of Injustice, developer NetherRealm also made the mobile iteration.

Rocket League's Dawn of Justice content takes the form of a Batmobile inspired by the movie, as well as flags for Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman. It arrives on March 8.

Dawn of Justice comes to theaters on March 25.
