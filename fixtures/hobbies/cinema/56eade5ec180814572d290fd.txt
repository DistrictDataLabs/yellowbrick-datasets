Gkids has announced the English-language voice cast for its French toon feature April and the Extraordinary World, and it’s stocked with names you likely recognize. Oscar winners Susan Sarandon and J.K. Simmons are joined by Emmy winners Paul Giamatti and Tony Hale for the sci-fi adventure pic set in an alternative steampunk world.



Angela Galuppo stars as April, the role voiced by Oscar winner Marion Cotillard in the French version. Tod Fennell, Tony Robinow, Mark Camacho and Macha Grenon round out the English cast of the film that won Best Feature at last year’s Annecy International Animation Festival.





Set in 1941 Paris, April and the Extraordinary World follows a family of scientists on the brink of discovering a powerful longevity serum.A mysterious force suddenly abducts them, leaving their young daughter April behind. Ten years later, April lives alone with her cat and carries on her family’s research in secret. But she soon finds herself at the center of a shadowy and far-reaching conspiracy — and on the run from government agents, bicycle-powered dirigibles and cyborg rat spies.

Gkids opens the film from first-time feature directors Christian Desmares & Franck Ekinci on March 25 in NYC, a week later in LA and expands April 8.
