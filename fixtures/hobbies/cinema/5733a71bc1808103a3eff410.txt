 Dare ... or bigger dare?



Truth has no place in an elaborate, social-driven, voyeuristic mobile game in 

 In it, people are either players or watchers, and the stakes can be life or death. When Vee (

) starts playing, the dares are harmless — kissing a random guy for five seconds. Then, the dares escalate, sending her into the city with that random guy (

), making her try on an expensive dress, getting at tattoo, etc.



But then, the game begins taking a darker turn, as their identities are stolen and their money taken — with watchers egging them on.




The trailer looks like a thriller in the vein of "Unfriended." It's got Roberts and Franco as the leads, constant use of smartphones, and the participation of a mostly invisible online audience. Horror's gone millennial!



"Nerve" opens in theaters July 27.
