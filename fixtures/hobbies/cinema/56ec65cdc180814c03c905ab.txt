EXCLUSIVE: Indie filmmakers take note: film and finance company Night Fox Entertainment, which is the entity behind such projects as Z For Zachariah starring Margot Robbie, Chiwetel Ejiofor and Chris Pine and the film Headlock starring Andy Garcia, Justin Bartha and Diana Agron, is now opening an acquisitions arm.



The four-year-old company which spent its first two years identifying projects before starting to finance films in 2014, said they are opening the acquisitions department to diversify their revenue streams, build their content library and to provide a distribution outlet for projects that cannot get distributed through the normal studio channels.

“We will look at acquiring films up to $5M within the urban, horror, romantic comedy and action genres,” Timothy Christian, CEO for the Omaha-based Night Fox Entertainment, told Deadline. “This is the next step for us strategically. We looked at partnering up with other companies, but in the end, we decided to open our own acquisitions arm. Building a library is a real key for us. Everybody wants content and this creates a bigger valuation for our entity. Being from Omaha and building the company here, we are able to look at the business from the outside, which is good in that we have a different perspective and so we haven’t fallen into some of the pitfalls that others have.”



The up-and-coming film financier also has an office in Los Angeles, but the acquisition hires will be done for the Omaha office. The Night Fox Entertainment staff consists of CEO Christian, President of production Ryan Johnson, President of acquisitions and development Rab Butler, President of Marketing Jerry Wolff  and operations director Nicole Gurnon.

Night Fox is currently financing a movie called East Texas Hotlinks with Samuel L. Jackson as the executive producer. And they also executive produced the horror film Wildling (with Maven Pictures) which stars Liv Tyler and Bel Powley.
