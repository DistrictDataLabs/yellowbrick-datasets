Hey folks, Harry here...   I'm watching FEAR THE WALKING DEAD season premiere with Father Geek, but keeping an eye on what's going on with The MTV MOVIE AWARDS - Really digging this new season, I've seen the first two episodes - and the 2nd episode really gives you a look at how the world went to hell, you see a map and it's pointed out just how bad it happened.   Pretty great stuff.   Meanwhile - here you can see Captain America, Scarlet Witch and The Falcon kicking the ass of men in all black that are completely ineffectual against the whup-ass they're facing...  Just take a look...  Looks like Cap has been doing some intense training with his team!   So great!

 

 





Keep it cool,

 

Harry
