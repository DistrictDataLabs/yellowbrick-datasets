TNT has given a pilot order to Civil, a political and social drama that sounds ominously close to real-life current events.



Written and executive produced by A Simple Plan scribe Scott Smith and directed by Allen Coulter (Ray Donovan), Civil takes place in the wake of a hotly contested Presidential election, as America finds itself plunging uncontrollably into a modern day Civil War. The series weaves together the personal stories of citizens from all walks of life, whose actions – amplified in an age of instant media – add fuel to the conflict and affect the fate of the entire country.

Former Copper executive producer Thomas Kelly will serve as executive producer/ showrunner.

TNT Originals is producing the pilot in association with MGM Television. Whalerock Industries’ Lloyd Braun is executive producer and Andrew Mittman is co-executive producer under MGM’s production deal with Whalerock.

Smith is repped by CAA, Circle of Confusion and Behr Abrasion Levy. Coulter is repped by UTA and Paul Alan Smith at Equitable Stewardship for Artists.
