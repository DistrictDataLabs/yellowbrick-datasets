Andrea Anders (Better Off Ted) is set as the female lead opposite Craig Ferguson in Crunch Time, NBC’s hybrid game show/comedy pilot written by Betsy Thomas based on an original idea by veteran game show producer Phil Gurin (Weakest Link)



Crunch Time, which intercuts between a real game show and the scripted workplace, centers on Emily (Anders), an up-and-coming producer trying to wrangle the volatile host, Toby (Ferguson). Driven, loyal and level-headed, Emily is finally running a show she created. She has put on hold a personal life in exchange for her career, and time is running out for her to “have it all.”

Co-starring in the pilot are Kyle Howard and Kellee Stewart. Thomas, David Janollari and Gurin executive produce for Universal TV.

Anders, who recently recurred on Modern Family, is repped by Gersh and manager Joe Rice.
