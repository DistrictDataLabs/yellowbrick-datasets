Rogue One: A Star Wars Story might be more of a family saga than initially believed — if star Mads Mikkelsen isn't having fun at the expense of a fanbase eager to jump on any potential piece of information about the Star Wars spin-off.

Talking to Sky News, the actor — who plays a mystery role in Gareth Edwards' movie, set prior to the very first Star Wars, and who was entirely absent from the first trailer for the movie — appeared to accidentally reveal that his character will have a close connection to Felicity Jones' lead character, Jyn Erso.

"I read the script and it was very beautiful, and Felicity is playing this lovely, strong woman and I play her father," he said, before adding, "And that was too much. I'm sorry." 

Teased by the interviewer that he could also reveal whether speculation over a Darth Vader appearance in the movie was true or not, he smiled and said, "Yes I can, but I won't."

Mikkelsen also talked briefly about Marvel's Doctor Strange, in which he also plays an unnamed character. "I believe I'm allowed to say that I play an opponent," he said. "Not really a baddie, but someone who believes in something else that Doctor Strange believes in."
