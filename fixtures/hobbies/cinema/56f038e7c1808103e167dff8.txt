Terry Curtin, a long-serving and highly regarded Hollywood publicist, has been named Head of Theatrical Publicity at DreamWorks Animation, the company announced this morning. Curtin, who begins her new job April 11, is well known from her exec perches at Universal Pictures, 20th Century Fox, Disney, Relativity, STX Entertainment and other entertainment companies.



She will oversee all global publicity efforts for DWA’s feature film slate including traditional and digital film PR campaigns, publicity events and experiential efforts, targeted campaign oversight, awards and publicity content and press communications for film-related talent.

Curtin replaces Robin Chandler, who is stepping down to launch an independent consulting practice, with DreamWorks Animation as an initial client, DWA said.









“I am incredibly excited that Terry will be joining us in this critical position,” said Jim Gallagher, Head of Theatrical Marketing for DreamWorks Animation. “She’s a strategic idea machine, who is equally comfortable down in the weeds or up at 30,000 feet. I’d like to thank Robin for all her incredible efforts, and am grateful to have her in an advisory role going forward as part of her new venture.”

Added Curtin, “I am thrilled to be joining Jim Gallagher and the DreamWorks Animation marketing department, and look forward to working closely with Bonnie Arnold and Mireille Soria, as well as the team at 20th Century Fox. What an advantage to be given the head-start of a globally recognized brand known for high quality storytelling and innovation, not to mention the strong slate of films ahead.”

Curtin joins DreamWorks Animation, having most recently served as Head of Strategic Marketing and Global Communications at STX Entertainment.
