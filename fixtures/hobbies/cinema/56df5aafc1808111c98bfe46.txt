The Directors Guild has two new assistant executive directors: Rachel Paster, who will work out of the guild’s offices in New York, and Steven Knauss, who’s assigned to the headquarters in Los Angeles.



“We are very pleased to have Rachel and Steven join our senior management team,” said DGA national executive director Jay Roth. “Their labor relations and union experience will be a valuable asset in negotiating and enforcing DGA agreements. We look forward to putting their extensive experience and skills to use in the service of our AD and UPM members.”

Paster, who will be involved in the administration of the guild’s film and television agreements and represent assistant directors and unit production managers in the Eastern region, is an attorney with more than 15 years of experience representing unions. Prior to joining the DGA, she was a partner in the labor law firm Lewis, Clifton & Nikolaidis, where she focused on representing labor unions in contract negotiations.



Knauss joined the DGA in 2013 as a field representative. Prior to that, he held a number of positions in the Nevada and Florida locals of the Service Employees International Union. In his new post, he’ll represent assistant directors and unit production managers in the Western region, serve as the staff liaison to the guild’s Western AD/UPM Council, and oversee matters related to set safety.
