MTV's Scream is hitting the reset button.

The reboot based on the feature film franchise of the same name has added six new faces to its cast (two of them series regulars) and set a May 31 premiere date for its second season.







Season two, which is in production in New Orleans, picks up with Emma’s (Willa Fitzgerald) return to Lakewood after several months at a retreat, where she tried to recover from the horrors of last season. Much like the Scream features and Neve Campbell's Sidney Prescott, everyone is walking on eggshells around Emma and questioning whether she has truly gotten over the killer’s crimes. Meanwhile, Audrey (Bex Taylor-Klaus) is hiding her connection to the killer, but is getting harassed by someone who knows the truth. Brooke (Carlson Young) and Jake (Tom Maden) are also keeping secrets — they are hiding a budding romance from Mayor Maddox (Bryan Batt). And, Noah (John Karna) is getting closer to the truth about the season one murders.

Joining the cast as series regulars are Kiana Lede (The Smurfs 2) as Zoe, a driven overachiever at the high school who harbors a secret; and Santiago Segura (Silicon Valley) as Gustavo Acosta, a dark and brooding outsider at the school who is a skilled artist that's deeply into horror, serial killers and comics.







Scream, which is undergoing a bit of a creative reboot under new showrunners Michael Gans and Richard Register (Make It or Break It, Celebrity Deathmatch), has also enlisted four newcomers to recur in season two. They are Anthony Ruivivar (Banshee, The CW's Frequency pilot) as Sheriff Michael Acosta, who returns to the town where he grew up, and is Gustavo's father; Austin Highsmith (Criminal Minds) as Karen Lang, a psychology teacher who becomes a confidant and mentor to her students; Sean Grandillo (Broadway's Spring Awakening) as Eli, Kieran's (Amadeus Serafini) cousin; and Katrina Logue (Bates Motel) as Tina Hudson, a proper girl with a grifter's sense of self-reliance.

Lede is repped by UTA and Primary Wave Music; Segura is with Greene & Associates and Primary Wave; Ruivivar is with Gersh and Silver Lining Entertainment; Highsmith is with Global Artists and Abrams Entertainment; Grandillo is with APA; and Logue is with SMS Talent and Vincent Cirrincione Associates.

The series returns Tuesday, May 31 at 10 p.m. on MTV.
