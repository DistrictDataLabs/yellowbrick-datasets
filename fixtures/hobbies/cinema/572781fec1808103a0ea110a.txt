Merle Haggard and Prince were remembered, Carrie Underwood sang, Chris Stapleton snagged Best Album of the year and Brooks & Dunn were given an Icon award at the 2nd American Country Countdown Awards (1.0/4). While the dick clark productions show didn’t break an ratings records, Fox must be breathing a bit easier as this year’s ACCA saw an uptick of 11% among adults 18-49 from the soft debut of the ceremony back on December 15, 2014 – a Monday.



With a heavily anticipated reveal on HBO’s Game Of Thrones and the Season 3 debut of Penny Dreadful on Showtime, an otherwise mainly tepid Sunday saw NBC tied with ABC to win the night among the 18-49s with a 1.1/4 rating. A big part of that for the Comcast-owned net was the return of the big ratings deal known as Little Big Shots (1.6/6). The top show of the night among the key demo by leaps and bounds, the Steve Harvey hosted series was almost even with its last original of April 17 – and could see an adjustment in the final numbers.

When we say that last night was tepid, we are not talking about NBC’s Sunday comedies. Promising results saw The Carmichael Show (1.0/3) and Crowded (0.8/2) getting double-digit demo rises. Undoubtedly helped by have a new LBS as a lead-in, Carmichael was up 43% among the demo over its April 24 show. Crowded didn’t see that kind of surge but it did jump up 14% over last week. Dateline (1.0/3) ended NBC’s night with a rise of a tenth itself.



For ABC, the night started well-ish with America’s Funniest Home Videos (1.3/5) bopping up 8% in the demo. However, then it all plateaued as Once Upon A Time (1.2/4), The Family (0.8/3) and Quantico (1.0/3) were all even with their April 24 shows.

The penultimate episode ever of The Good Wife (1.0/3) saw the multiple Emmy winner also even with last week, as was Madam Secretary (1.0/4) and 60 Minutes (1.0/4). Elementary (0.8/3) ended CBS’ night with a rise of tenth over its April 24 show.
