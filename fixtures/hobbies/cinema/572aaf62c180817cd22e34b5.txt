Family Guy has always been topical in its Emmy campaign mailers, but this time, the irreverent animated comedy has showed some impeccable timing, sending out its Donald Trump-themed mailers just as the reality TV star-turned-politician was anointed as Republican Party’s presidential nominee.



Family Guy‘s designated Emmy pitchman, Peter Griffin, is channeling his inner Donald Trump in another blunt message to Emmy voters, “As long as we’re voting for dumb loudmouths, can I get an Emmy?” Two years ago, Griffin impersonated top Trump supporter Chris Christie, threatening Emmy voters with a New Jersey “bridgegate” style traffic problems. And of course, there was the 2010 Emmy mailer classic that featured Peter Griffin as the girl from Precious and the slogan Vote For Us Or You’re Racist.
