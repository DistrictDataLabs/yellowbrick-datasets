Making a seven-figure deal, Universal has scooped up an untitled comedy pitch with Will Ferrell attached to star.

Brendan O’Brien, who co-wrote Universal’s Seth Rogen-Zac Efron comedy Neighbors, will pen the project, which will be produced by Ferrell and Adam McKay and the duo’s Gary Sanchez banner. O'Brien also wrote and executive produced Universal's upcoming sequel Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising.

The story kicks off when an escaped convict teams up with an unlikely partner (Ferrell) to stop his girlfriend from getting married.

O'Brien and Gary Sanchez's Jessica Elbaum also will produce, while Chris Henchy will executive produce. Universal's Erik Baiers will oversee the project on behalf of the studio.

Ferrell and O'Brien have a budding buddy-comedy relationship of their own. O'Brien most recently co-wrote and produced New Line's The House, which stars Ferrell and Amy Poehler. That film will be released in June 2017.

Ferrell's recent comedy projects include Daddy's Home and Zoolander 2. He also produced Universal's The Boss alongside Melissa McCarthy and Ben Falcone’s On the Day Prods. That film opened last weekend at No. 1.

Ferrell is repped by UTA, Mosaic and attorney Deborah Klein.

O'Brien, who also wrote Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates for Fox, is handled by UTA and Hansen, Jacobson.
