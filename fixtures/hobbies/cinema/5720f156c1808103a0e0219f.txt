Ryan Reynolds’ follow-up film to his record-smashing superhero hit Deadpool is now before cameras. Principal photography began today in London on Millennium Films’ action comedy The Hitman’s Bodyguard, which stars Reynolds, Samuel L. Jackson, Gary Oldman, Elodie Yung and Salma Hayek.



Patrick Hughes is now directing the script by Tom O’Connor. Kick-Ass 2 helmer Jeff Wadlow had been attached to this one, but Hughes — who teamed with Millennium as director of Expendables 3 — signed on last month. Lionsgate is distributing in the U.S. and the UK.

The pic centers on the world’s top protection agent (Reynolds) and his new client: a notorious hitman who came in from the cold (Jackson). They’ve been on opposite ends of a bullet for years. They hate each other. Now they’re stuck together and have 24 hours to get from England to The Hague. The only thing standing in their way is everything a murderous Eastern European dictator (Oldman) can throw at them.



Mark Gill, John Thompson, Matt O’Toole and Les Weldon are producing. Avi Lerner, Trevor Short, Boaz Davidson, Christine Otal, Douglas Urbanski, Jason Bloom, Christa Campbell and Lati Grobman are exec producers.
