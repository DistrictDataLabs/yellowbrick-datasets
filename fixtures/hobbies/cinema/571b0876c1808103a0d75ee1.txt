Kelly Ripa is returning to host her show Live With Kelly and Michael on Tuesday. 

In an email sent to the show's staff late Friday night, Ripa said that she was a no-show this week because she needed time to process her co-host Michael Strahan's departure, but that she will return soon. 

“(Sorry for this late Friday night email)," she said in the email. "I wanted to thank you all for giving me the time to process this new information. Your kindness, support, and love has overwhelmed me. We are a family and I look forward to seeing you all on Tuesday morning. Love, Kelly.”

She didn't show up to Live on Wednesday after hearing the news that Strahan would be leaving for a full-time post at Good Morning America. Ripa, the show's staff and executive producer Michael Gelman didn't learn about his departure after Tuesday's show. 

Ana Gasteyer and Erin Andrews took her place for the episodes she missed. Pretty Little Liars star Shay Mitchell will co-host with Strahan on Monday due to a previously scheduled vacation of Ripa's, a spokesperson told The Hollywood Reporter.
