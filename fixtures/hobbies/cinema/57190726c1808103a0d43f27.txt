Netflix gets all the love, but Amazon does have a competing streaming video service called Amazon Prime (which I've been a subscriber of for a few years), and it too does refresh its monthly offerings just like Netflix. It may not boasts the same number of subscribers as Netflix does, but I'm sure a lot of you are members, and you use the service just like I do. In fact, I actually don't have a favorite streaming service. Netflix and Amazon get the most play in my house, but neither dominates. There's also of course Hulu, and other relatively smaller players which I might highlight as well.

For today, here's the list of films and TV shows that will be coming to Amazon's streaming library in May. Of special note, timed almost perfectly (although coincidentally) with yesterday's announcement that Lifetime is developing a film on the life of 1920’s New York City mobster Queenie (born Stephanie St. Clair), is Bill Duke's gangland crime drama "Hoodlum" (1997), in which Queenie was played by Cicely Tyson, as some of you might recall. Kenny Leon is attached to direct the film. There's also "Mystery Team" - the film that introduced a lot of us to Donald Glover 7 years ago. You can also catch Jeffrey Wright's first season on HBO's "Boardwalk Empire" as season 4 becomes available on Amazon Prime next month.

And there are others... so take a look below as there might be something or three that you like.
