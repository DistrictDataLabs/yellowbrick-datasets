NBCUniversal Short Film Festival


Short film directors, if you dare to dream of being the next Tina Fey, have we got a contest for you.

NBCUniversal has announced that its 11th annual Short Film Festival is now accepting submissions.

The diversity-seeking festival is "a nationwide search for talent both in front of and behind the camera, focused on discovering the next generation of storytellers." The fest seeks narrative content made within the last two years in drama or comedy categories. 

This year, the festival will allow stand-alone web series episodes and also extends the maximum length of submissions to 22 minutes to allow for comedic pilot presentations. 

The goal, NBCUniversal says, is "to not only celebrate up and coming directors, writers, producers and actors, but to introduce them to top industry taste makers while awarding prizes ranging from camera packages and monetary grants to development meetings and holding deals." 

Last year, they partnered with Geena Davis and the Oxygen Network to award one female filmmaker with a prize package including a multitude of camera equipment, a new iMac computer, as well as development meetings with top executives at the network.

The submissions window is open from now until May 15. Visit NBCUshortsFEST.com to enter. Head out there and find your Amy Poehler or your Ellie Kemper and make some magic.
