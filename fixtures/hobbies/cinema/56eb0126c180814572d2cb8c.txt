Without fanfare or bluster, Patricia Riggen has forged an impressive path as a woman director. The Mexican filmmaker helmed two studio films released within six months of each other, and it looks like her newest feature, "Miracle From Heaven," may strike big at the box office.

Jennifer Garner stars in the faith-based film, an adaptation of Christy Beam's 2015 memoir. Garner plays Christy, the mother to a child (Kylie Rogers, "The Whispers") dealt a tragically unfair hand in life -- an incurable disease. The fate of the Beam family is radically altered when an accident miraculously cures her.

"Miracles From Heaven" opened yesterday at 3,047 theaters and grossed $1.9 million, making it the second highest earning film of the day behind "Zootopia." "Miracles" audiences were composed mostly of women -- 69%, to be exact. The drama currently holds an A+ rating at CinemaScore, so it's seemingly striking a chord with audiences, and presumably Christian audiences most especially.Â  

"Miracles From Heaven" opened on 3,000+ screens and is being distributed by Tri-Star. Riggen's previous film, Chilean miner drama "The 33," opened on 2,500+ screens and was distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures. 

It's uncommon for women directors to get wide distribution for their films, and the fact that Riggen managed to score it twice within half-a-year span is extremely noteworthy.
