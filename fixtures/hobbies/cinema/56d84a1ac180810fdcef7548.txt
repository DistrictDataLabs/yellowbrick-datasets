For the sad few on the internet who are still appalled that women (gasp!) have been cast in the lead roles of upcoming "Ghostbusters" reboot, Sony Pictures honcho Tom Rothman has a very simple message. "Everybody says I'm making the female Ghostbusters, but I say, 'No, we're making the funny Ghostbusters.' Yes, it happens to be four women. It's original. You get pissing and moaning on the Internet — sexist comments – but, you know, fuck 'em," he said in November. And you know what? He's right.

That said, it's perfectly all right to wonder if the movie will be good (or not), and the first trailer is here for everyone to scrutinize. Melissa McCarthy, Kristen Wiig, Kate McKinnon, and Leslie Jones, are the lead quartet, who will come together, proton packs ready, to fight the latest supernatural threat. Director Paul Feig ("Bridesmaids," "Spy") is behind the camera, and as far as stakes go, this is probably his biggest movie ever, with a franchise riding on his shoulders. Helping to bridge the gap will be cameos by Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Ernie Hudson, Sigourney Weaver, and Annie Potts (from the previous films) in a new roles, and the appearance of a classic character.

"I got to work with Slimer, dude. Like Slimer!!! I’m in a scene with Slimer! I’m a huge Ghostbusters fan and it was a dream come true," Michael K. Williams told EW, while teasing a little bit about his role and plot. “I play the FBI agent who works for the mayor. Our whole thing is, we’re going to tell the people it was a flash in the sky and ‘Run along little women with your ghosts, we got this.’ " But obviously, they don't, and they'll have to call in for some help.

Co-starring Chris Hemsworth, Andy Garcia, Neil Casey, Cecily Strong, and Matt Walsh, "Ghostbusters" arrives on July 15th. Watch below.
