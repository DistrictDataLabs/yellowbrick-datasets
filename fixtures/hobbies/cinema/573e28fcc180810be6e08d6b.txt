	        	The Taiwanese-American stars in past and recent films. 


Last week the hashtag #StarringJohnCho trended on Twitter as a way to highlight the lack of Asian actors in leading roles. This time around, the new campaign #StarringConstanceWu is tackling the same premise but featuring the "Fresh Off the Boat" star Constance Wu photoshopped into past and recent films. 


The Taiwanese-American actress can be seen next to Matthew McConaughey in the poster for "Ghosts of Girlfriends Past," "Mother's Day," "Friends With Benefits," "Easy A," as Katniss Everdeen in "The Hunger Games" and even in the film "Aloha," which received backlash for casting Emma Stone to play an Asian American character.

The movement comes from recent whitewashing accusations towards Hollywood regarding casting choices for "Doctor Strange," where Tilda Swinton was cast as the originally-written Tibetan character The Ancient One, and "Ghost in the Shell," which cast Scarlett Johansson as a formerly Japanese character. Margaret Cho also started the #whitewashedOUT discussion about lack of leading roles and being succumbed to minor roles.

Wu also took notice of the campaign and showed her support, tweeting about her face swap with Stone.
