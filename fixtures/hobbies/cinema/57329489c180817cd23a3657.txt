Warner Bros Pictures has moved its Godzilla sequel back by nine months to a presummer 2019 slot and dated the giant lizard’s battle against King Kong for 14 months later. Godzilla 2, director  Gareth Edwards‘ follow-up to his 2014 film starring Bryan Cranston, has been pushed to March 22, 2019; it had been slated for the previous June 8. And the Godzilla vs Kong throwdown will open in the summer sweet spot of May 29, 2020.



Godzilla 2 had been slated for an epic battle against the next Transformers behemoth that weekend, but now it will face off against Paramount’s Amusement Park, starring Matthew Broderick and Jennifer Garner. They both arrive two weeks after Disney’s Captain Marvel. Godzilla vs Kong has that next-decade date to itself.

The studio also dated an Untitled WB Event Film for Christmas Day 2018 and moved its Untitled DC Film back by a month from June 19, 2020, to July 24. The earlier date would have pic the mystery superhero pic up against an Untitled Pixar film, but the new date is all its own for now. In fact, it’s only the second movie slated for July 2020 at the moment.



Fanboys, commence theorizing.
