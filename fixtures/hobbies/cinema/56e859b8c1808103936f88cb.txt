Starz is nearing a deal to pick up Sophie Goodhart's SXSW premiere "My Blind Brother," Variety reports. The outlet shares that the acquisition "will likely be the biggest sale out of this year’s South by Southwest" and is estimated to be in the low seven-figure range. The comedy, which stars Adam Scott, Nick Kroll and Jenny Slate, was reportedly the subject of a bidding war amongst distributors like Netflix, The Orchard, Sony and Gravitas Ventures.

Per the film's official synopsis, the film amusingly chronicles what happens when "love for the same woman creates a rift between an over-achieving blind athlete and his resentful brother."
