If you feel ecstatic or disappointed when you walk out of BATMAN V SUPERMAN this weekend, it’s hard to argue against the fact that one of the major points of anticipation is the first appearance of Wonder Woman.

That appearance will serve as an introduction to the character before she gets her own badass movie in 2017. Wonder Woman finally getting her own flick is something that fans have been clamoring for, and we all hope director Patty Jenkins will do the character justice and give fans what they have been cheering for.

The film is already starting off strong with the release of this image (via EW). We get a good look at Diana (Gal Gadot) and the other powerful women of Themyscira. Here, we see her flanked by her mother, Queen Hippolyta (Connie Nielsen) and her aunts Antiope (Robin Wright) and Menalippe (Lisa Loven Kongsli). We are told that all three women have a hand in raising Diana, which causes some conflicts among them. Hippolyta wants to keep her sheltered and protected from the outer world, whereas Antiope is more interested in training the young warrior for battle.

The image is powerful and completely badass. Jenkins is aiming to make the costume design appealing and empowering for women, going for a tough, warrior-like, yet fantasy-inspired look.

“It’s total wish-fulfillment...I, as a woman, want Wonder Woman to be hot as hell, fight badass, and look great at the same time – the same way men want Superman to have huge pecs and an impractically big body. That makes them feel like the hero they want to be. And my hero, in my head, has really long legs.”

WONDER WOMAN opens on June 23, 2017. What do you guys think?
