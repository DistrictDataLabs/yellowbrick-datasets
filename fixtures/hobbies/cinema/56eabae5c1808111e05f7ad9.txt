Democratic presidential-race frontrunner Hillary Clinton is making a return appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live on Thursday, March 24.



No stranger to late-night, this will be Clintonâ€™s second appearance on Kimmel. She last visited in November. Her appearance comes two days before Democratic caucuses in Alaska, Hawaii and Washington.

Additional guests on the 24th include Peter Krause and musical guest Fifth Harmony.
