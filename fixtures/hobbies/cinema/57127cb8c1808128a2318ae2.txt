	        	The anticipated sequel is in the works. 


The logo for “Zombieland 2” was debuted at CinemaCon earlier this week. The long-promised sequel to the 2009 indie flick is said to be in development at Sony. The new logo is the classic one that fans first saw, except with the added number. 


No additional plot news was reported about the sequel to the comedy-horror film starring Jesse Eisenberg, Emma Stone and Woody Harrelson. What we do know is that Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick, who wrote the first “Zombieland,” are penning the script. Dave Callaham (“Godzilla”) is also onboard as writer with Ruben Fleischer as director. 

“We only need to do it if it’s done right,” the writers previously said of their zombie sequel.

When “Zombieland” was first released audiences saw, a relatively unknown to the mainstream, Eisenberg and Stone join forces with Harrelson’s character, Tallahassee, and Abigail Breslin as Wichita, as they tried to defeat a zombie-filled America to get to an amusement park. 


With a production budget of $23.6 million, and low expectations, the Fleischer helmed film was a total success taking in over $100 million at the box office. It wasn’t long before talks of a sequel followed. As the years passed that hope slowly became to dwindle down, that is until now. 


In 2013 Reese and Wernick produced a TV pilot for Amazon with a whole new cast, but was dropped after poor reviews from audiences.
