If you didn’t have a nonna to do so when you were a 

, it’s more than likely that Marcella Hazan was the person who introduced you to the concept of a spaghetti frittata, a cozy mess of leftover spaghetti, scrambled egg, some butter, parsley and a fistful of parmesan, cooked in a skillet and cut into wedges. It’s unfancy food at its best, as should be no surprise from the woman who was very distressed by complicated chefs’ recipes, wondering 





So when I first saw Food & Wine’s Cacio e Pepe Pasta Pie on Pinterest earlier this month, as one does, my first thought was “Oooh, so impossible-to-achieve outside a food styling studio pretty,” (because, I mean, look at it) followed by “Wait, that’s not cacio e pepe” (a Roman dish with exactly three ingredients — pecorino, black pepper and spaghetti, usually fresh tonnarelli, and if you can forgive me for being pedantic, definitely no cheddar), followed by “Wouldn’t all of that egg custard leak from my springform?” (answer: yes, and woe is my oven floor) and then “I wonder what Marcella Hazan would have thought of this.” Would she have been distraught by the springform, perturbed by the use of three types of cheese, shaking her head over the finish under the broiler?








Well, if she’s anything like the rest of us, I think she’d be too busy enjoying it to ask such questions because this dish — which I’d liken to the halfway point between a spaghetti frittata and a spaghetti quiche — is spectacular. I made it on a whim a couple weeks ago (because that’s my thing these days) and even though my peeling wood-veneer kitchen counter is the furthest cry from a photography studio, it was a total stunner. And while this is unequivocally comfort food — pasta, eggs, and a glorious amount of cheese, yesss — something about eating it in tall wedges with a green salad felt almost civilized, humble food raised to its most centerpiece-worthy calling, and all from just a handful of ingredients. We’re going to be making this a lot this winter, I can tell.

Spaghetti Pie with Pecorino and Black Pepper
Adapted from Justin Chapple at Food & Wine

This pie plays off the flavors of classic cacio e pepe — these flavors will be, delightfully, the strongest — but, of course, I fiddled with it a little. The first time, I made it with 8 ounces each of pecorino romano and fontina (because although I love cheddar, I just couldn’t). The second time, I made with less of each (which was a mistake) and because I’ve become That Person, the kind of person that needs to see some green before I can allow something to become a regular meal, I added about a cup of blanched and finely chopped broccoli rabe (which was not). That said, while we enjoyed our green-flecked spaghetti wedges, we agreed we’d have liked it just as much with the greens on the side, preferably in a garlicky and pepper flake sauteed heap. 

A few important cooking notes: You must wrap your springform tightly in foil or you and your oven floor will end up in a very bad mood. Please (I beg here) cook your pasta until it’s a good two minutes from done as it will continue cooking in the oven and mushy pasta makes me sad. The greens here are optional (see above) but keep in mind that if you add them, you’ll want to do your best to remove every extra drop of moisture and anticipate that it will take longer to set. Finally, to me, good aged pecorino (usually sold with a black rind) makes all the difference here in providing a salty, funky kick. You can use parmesan if it’s all you’ve got, but you might find that you need more salt if you do.
 
Butter for greasing springform
1/2 pound broccoli rabe, toughest stems saved for another use, chopped into few-inch segments (optional)
1 pound dried spaghetti
1 1/2 cups milk
3 large eggs, lightly beaten
2 to 3 teaspoons ground black pepper
2 teaspoons coarse or kosher salt
8 ounces aged pecorino cheese, finely grated, divided
8 ounces fontina cheese, grated, divided

Heat oven to 425 degrees. Butter a 9-inch springform pan and this is very important, wrap the outside of the springform, focusing on the places where the ring meets the base, tightly in aluminum foil. Set aside.

Bring a large pot of well-salted water to a boil. If using broccoli rabe, add it to the pot and boil for 1 to 2 minutes, until it has some give. Fish it out with a large slotted spoon and drain it well. Set aside.

Add spaghetti to boiling water and cook until (this is also important) 2 minutes shy of done, so very al dente, as the spaghetti will continue cooking in the oven. Drain well and let cool slightly.

If using broccoli rabe, wring all extra moisture out of it and blot greens on paper towels to be extra careful. Mince rabe into very small bits. You’ll have about 1 cup total.

In a large bowl, whisk eggs and milk together with salt and pepper. Stir in all but 1/2 cup of each cheese and chopped rabe, if using. Add spaghetti and toss to coat. 

Pour into prepared springform and sprinkle remaining cheese on top. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes (without greens) and up to 15 minutes more (with greens, as they add moisture too), until the cheese is melted and bubbling and a knife inserted into the center of the pie and turned slightly will not release any loose egg batter into the center. If the top of your pie browns too quickly before the center is set, cover it with foil for the remaining cooking time.

Turn on your oven’s broiler. Broil the pie a few inches from the heat for 2 to 3 minutes, until browned on top. Cut along springform ring to loosen, then remove ring. Run a spatula underneath the pie to loosen the base and slide onto a serving plate. Cut into wedges.

AD — I suspect it would be just fine in a cast-iron skillet, but you might be safest going to a 10-inch as they can be less tall than springforms.

If I were able to get around my city (DC) without careening into huge snow banks today, I’d rush out and get these ingredients right now… it’s stunning! 
Also, just a little sidebar speaking of Marcella Hazan… have you ever tried her smothered cabbage or smothered cabbage and rice soup? I heard about it a while back on Orangette and oh dear, it is the most transformative and delicious thing I’ve ever done to cabbage. Big recommend.

This is a timely recipe for my house!  We tried the NYT version of cacio e pepe last week, and the cheese just got too clumpy to be good.  This looks very doable and delicious.  I really think I am making this tonight.  Thank you!

I am planning a meal for a ski weekend and this could very well be the ticket! large and comforting and easy to make.
I’m wondering about variations:
* vegetables: anything other than broccoli rabe that would be a good fit? like maybe regular broccoli, or sundried tomatoes and spinach? And any harm in adding more than the amount you used? (I’m definitely That Person as well when it comes to veggies, but don’t want to get too out of balance and have the pie fall apart.)
* meat: would chopped ham or bacon (cooked separately and fat drained) work, in addition to or instead of the veggies?

OMG, I love spaghetti pies. I was thinking of making one this past weekend but didn’t get around to it. Geez, maybe I’m telepathic? If you were also thinking of making chocolate cake, we might have evidence for telepathy.  
Back to spaghetti pies, @Michelle, sundried tomatoes would be heaven, IMHO. I’m biased, I eat them straight from the jar, because I’m an adult and therefore I can. I bet olives would be good too, but would change the flavor a lot from Deb’s original. So I’d have to make two, the original, and then then variations. Twist my arm. Speaking of variations, FWIW, Deborah Madison has another great noodle pie, using linguine instead of spaghetti, fresh basil and feta for flavors. It’s in her Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone.

Other additions — The key things to keep in mind are
1) They must be chopped very small or they won’t toss well with spaghetti.
2) If they are wet, you might consider reducing the amount of milk or it might take forever to set. Even with very well wrung-out and dabbed on paper towels greens, ours took an additional 15 minutes to set.
3) I love the idea of a meal-in-one-pan but as you’re probably going to want to have something else on your plate besides the wedge of pie, this is also a perfect place to add a green vegetable or proscuitto. Plus, you’ll get a lot more vegetables in on the side. I wouldn’t add too much more than 1 finely chopped cup of vegetables (as we did) here.

Just echoing Allie’s comment from above re: Hazan’s smothered cabbage soup… It is in my personal Top 5 list for comfort food, and I make it at least several times every year to survive frigid Michigan winters. It sure doesn’t look pretty, but after one taste, I don’t care.

The pasta pie looks yum, but I want more info on your cutting board.  Dimensions and thickness please!  I’m taking a woodworking class and am on a cutting board kick.  I made a ginormous over-the-sink cutting board for my nephew and his wife for Christmas because they had no counter space and am thinking about smaller ones now.

This is similar to a favorite recipe from Gourmet March 1993 called Pepperoni Spaghetti Cakes. Same principle–cooked pasta mixed with egg and cheese binder– but with the addition of finely chopped red pepper, scallions, garlic, and pepperoni (or salami) and cooked in a skillet with olive oil to form a flat cake with a nice “crust” on both sides. Yum!

Definitely agree about mushy pasta. Just made the baked ziti from The Food Lab cookbook, in which it is recommended to soak dried pasta in hot water for 30 mins instead of boiling it when ultimately baking pasta. Tried this with the ziti and it was successful. 
Spaghetti pie was one of my favorites as a kid, so I’m definitely going to try this recipe with The Food Lab’s style.

This is called a “timballo”, similar to Food and Wine, May 2015, Justin Chapple: Cacio e Pepe Pasta Pie (yes, it has white cheddar and fontina besides the pecorino, but it works, this is quite different from the classic cacio e pepe pasta). A tip for the leaky springform pan is to cut a slightly bigger round of parchment paper and lock the springform pan over it so that it acts like a washer in a faucet, but you must use one with the outer lip as shown in the photos above. Only a bead of cheese sauce will ooze out. I am afraid Martha Stewart’s latest cheesecake pan only at Macy’s  is the easiest solution. With a  normal springform pan the leakage can seep under the cavity under the overturned bottom (so there is no lip to catch the product after baking) filling it up. In any case always use a parchment round in the upside down bottom of a cheesecase pan—you can then just slide off the finished result.

Oh this dish brings up so many childhood memories! My mediterrenean grandmother often made this on a whim, but here’s the twist: she used to fry it…. Wait until the oil is hot and spoon the spaghetti-egg mixture into the pan – flip once with the use of a plate. It used to be crunchy from the outside but soft and oozy from the inside, sometimes she would even add bacon!

My grandma used to make “spaghetti pie” all the time, except hers included little bits of sausage or meatball. It’s one of those recipes that was always relayed to me as “Oh, just throw in whatever is in the kitchen! Some of this, some of that!” and so as a staunch recipe follower, I have always been hesitant to make it myself. But this!! You have given me a recipe! Can’t wait to try it. :)

I fry this – and use no eggs. The spaghetti set anyway.its more like a giant spaghetti pancake maybe, and it’s a great way to use leftovers.  I actually always make more spaghetti than we can eat so we have leftovers for this! Also, it only takes 10 minutes or so.
The fancy thing would be to cook them in a wok, sautéed with oli, garlic,  anchovies and capers,  and unmould a giant spaghetti dome!

I make a version that goes way back to the original Silver Palate cook book, described as a fritatta.  This one is constructed in two layers: the first the regular spaghetti mixture topped with a bit of spaghetti sauce and sausage but not to the edge, then topped by the regular spaghetti mixture and topped with cheese and cooked as you suggest..  I still make this once or twice a winter, and my guests are always freaked out when they see the slice with the red sauce peeking through.  The tomato also adds a bit of acid to the taste profile and gives a little bit of a “punch” in flavor.

This kills my non-grain eating heart. Well, non-grain eating about 80% of the time. Which means… this is TOTALLY HAPPENING. Damn, Deb. This looks so so crazy good. My favorite thing to do with leftover long pasta is add it to a couple whisked eggs and make a franken-omelet, topped with parmesan. Yes yes yes to this.

Id like to make this for friends, but we need to got other is instead of our house. Could I bake and reheat/add extra cheese on top? They live about 20-30 minutes from us in Dallas metro. They have a wee tot, so I’m thinking of leaving these leftovers as they would go well. :)

Like Erica (#13), I also bought a Kuhn Rikon Push Pan and really like it.  It does not leak.  I have had a bit of trouble with it not releasing cleanly on the sides when you push the bottom up.  I called Kuhn Rikon about it and they told me they no longer produce that pan.  So, I am not sure if another company will be making it or if it will no longer be available.  It has been the only springform type pan I have ever owned that did not leak.  Not one drop.

If I were to make this and then freeze it how would I reheat? Or if I were to give it away as a frozen meal, how would this work? In my mind the beautiful spaghetti pie collapses in to a nasty looking heap

I wonder about trying it with some pepato cheese (goat cheese with peppercorns).  We are lucky enough to have a splendidly old-fashioned Italian grocery story in town (the kind that has whole dried fish in baskets, giant cheeses tied with ropes hanging from the ceiling, and a dozen kinds of olives in giant plastic buckets with help-yourself ladles).  Many years ago I went in and they gave me a free slice of pepato and I’ve been hooked every since.

We grew up with spaghetti pie. Never in the oven but we have always done it in a nonstick pan. We do it with just pasta, egg, salt and pepper, parm. It’s great before fried as well. 
In case your wondering how to flip. Cover the pan with a big plate. Flip the pan over and slide pie back in. This is a wonderful dish and great comfort food. Keep posting amazing recipes.

may I suggest to add a couple spoonfuls of powdered milk (whole or skim) to the egg custard if you are to use veggies in it? It’s a very simple trick that does wonders to soak up excess moisture and maybe save some precious baking time – so that your pasta doesn’t get too mushy!
I am totally making this carbonara-style for dinner tonight – with bacon and lots of pecorino. Thanks for the idea!

OOOOOMG! This looks so yummo. I’m always looking for recipes that my kids will eat that include eggs (our chickens are WAY ahead of us most weeks). This looks like it fits the bill. I might try adding some chopped red pepper, maybe even some onion. I need more veggies in my carbs. I could see even adding ham for the boys. Hmmm….this could be a very useful recipe – thanks!! (btw, LOVE your recipes but rarely take time to tell you that!)

I read your email at 5:30 this morning and remembered the leftover pasta in my fridge-only a 1/2 pound or so.  So I proceeded to warm up my cast iron skillet after mixing up the leftovers with s couple of eggs, cream, parsley (the only greens I had readily) and Pecorino Romano cheese.  Can I just tell you how good my kitchen smelled on a rainy Wednesday morning???? It was a fabulous breakfast, with leftovers!

My mom (who was not Italian, but learned to cook from my dad’s Italian mother) used to make spaghetti pie when I was a kid and I loved it!  She would make it in a regular pie dish, so not as lofty and high as your spring form version, but still perfect.  I’ve made spaghetti frittata before as a variation, but think I’m going to have to try the spring form version you did here.  And, yes, always, always Locatelli Pecorino Romano, it is the best!

Like Jessica HZ (#35) mentioned, I was also wondering about using foil to line the pan.  The foil is going to the recycling bin either way and this strategy would save a dish washing!  Any reason not to cook custardy pasta in well buttered foil?  Seems the only way to improve on this recipe would be to reducing collateral dish dirtying, so I welcome any insight!

Great recipe and pics, and interesting comments thereon.  IF I were to add veggies, I’d use chives, leeks and green onions – yes, the green tops, too! – and yellow onions, in respectively smaller portions relative to the amount of spaghetti used.  As the guy who “revolutionized the concept of stuffed cabbage by baking it in a Bundt pan” – surely you’ve heard?  ;0) – I like the angel food cake pan option, and believe that a nice coat of olive oil would ensure its releasing the pie intact; same would seem to work with a Calphalon pan, too, but watch the rivets!  Consider cooking the spaghetti in a chicken or beef broth, and reduce the sale accordingly, to complement the onions’ flavor.  And, if you’re lucky enough to find a wheel of marked-down Manchego – roughly akin to a capricious Swiss – sub that for the pecorino a/o fontina.  Don’t be shy with the pepper[s], and make sure you used good fresh ones; consider black and white, but not the off-tasting pink.  Buon appetito!

I just made this for dinner. Winner! My husband loved it. As far as how many does it serve, well, uh, it depends on how much you want to pig out. Paul and I ate 2/3 of it with a nice hearty red wine. Yum. I used 2 1/2 t. pepper. It seemed a bit pepper-heavy, which blocked out the taste of the cheeses. I will use less next time. I am not a fan of pecorino (sorry, everyone!) so I substituted Toscano, which was wonderful. I also used fresh organic basil and parsley (no rabe). Very good and pretty too! Thank you Deb. You obviously hit it out of the park (or should I say pantry) on this one! Rainy and windy here on the West Coast too, but in the 50’s. We are spoiled!

Being raised in Italian households, spaghetti pie wasn’t something you made fresh. It was a delicious way to use the leftover pasta from the night before. It is still one of my favorites made by my Nonna and my mother as well. Our family’s tradition is to use the leftover pasta with red meat sauce mixed in, add some diced  thick-cut cooked pancetta or even dried sweet italian sausage bits, along with egg, a bit of milk and cheese. Mix it up throw it in a cast iron pan and cook on stove on low til starts to set, then finish in the oven. I do love the idea of adding some greens though! Love it for breakfast cold….yum.

Re, using fresh pasta — I do think it could work but I also think it’s even more likely than dried pasta to get overcooked. I wonder if you just drop it for one minute max in boiling water would be best.

I made this for supper tonight, in the spirit of not filing recipes away to make “later”. I had to use what I had on hand, so parmesan and provolone filled in for the cheeses. I served broccoli on the side, omitting in the pie.There are only two of us, so I cooked about 2/3 of the recipe and used an 8″ springform pan. It was set and nicely browned in 35 minutes. We both enjoyed it very much; my husband commented several times on how delicious it was.
Such a delicious and simple recipe to have in my arsenal, with ingredients I always have on hand. Thanks Deb!

I made this last night and it was soooo delicious! I knew my kids would be suspicious of anything green so omitted the broccoli rabe. My son said ‘it’s like mac and cheese but much more tasty!’ Served with a roasted chicken and steamed broccoli. Comfort food at its best!

lauren — Although someone probably has, it’s not the kind of dish I’d use for one. The pasta will end up overcooked and the prep is very a la minute, tossed together at the last minute and immediately served/eaten.

Made this for a group lunch at work and it got rave reviews! I prepped it the night before and popped it into the oven at work and it was WONDERFUL! I did put aluminum foil over it after about 10 minutes because it was already nicely browned. I used broccolini instead of broccoli rabe and it was a good substitute. Thanks again for a great recipe!

What do you think about adding a ladle of tomato sauce over the top of each slice?  Would that overshadow anything?  It sounds like some acidity would be nice.

I don’t know if it’s just me but I’m slightly confused as to when you add some/all of the broccoli rabe. Looks like you add half to the eggs, but then it doesn’t say to add the other half, so maybe I’m reading it wrong? Anyway I added it all at once which is the best conclusion I can come to. In the oven now- smells good!

This was easy and so incredibly good. I opted for greens on the side due to time constraints, but will try incorporating them next time. My younger set called it fancy mac and cheese, though the grown ups thought it was more like a baked alfredo. Regardless, it was a hit. And because I couldn’t find the 9″ springform pan (where IS that thing hiding?!), I baked this in a tube pan and the unexpected upside was more crispy edges, which was my favorite part.

This was my first experience with spaghetti pie -ever!- and it’s a winner! I made it over the weekend with whole wheat spaghetti, parmigiana instead of pecorino, fresh parsley, thinly sliced prosciutto and topped it with breadcrumbs. AMAZING! We thought the presentation was fun, it reheats wonderfully, it’s super quick and easy to throw together and we’re eating our third meal out of it tonight! Thanks for the warning about the foil – I put it on a sheet pan and felt immense sadness for your oven floor as I pulled it out of the oven! :/

This looks delicious!  Persian-styled pasta is served in a similar way (no idea on the history behind it but Persians love all things crispy – i.e., tah dig – the crispy rice at the bottom of a pot).

Discovered that I was out of foil! Have a bundt silicon pan and used that instead of a spring form. While the topping wasn’t as pretty, it worked out great as an emergency stand by.

I made this last night and it was so delicious (and I am soooooo glad you added the instructions about wrapping in foil because that would have been a huge mess).  I did not use the broccoli rabe because my husband and son wouldn’t have eaten it.  The only change I would make next time is that I served this with a wilted spinach and pancetta salad and it really needed something with more acid/brightness to contrast with the flavors of the spaghetti pie.

And it is also the fourth recipe that’s made it onto the meal plan from SK in a 2-week time span!

Yum! Made this the other night as a test run because I wanted to serve it to guests tonight. 1) I’ve been making lots of homemade pasta this month, tried it in this without any pre-cooking, and it came out perfectly cooked. 2) I suspected the Italian Fontina might be too strong a flavor, so I did 6oz each of Fontina & Pecorino, plus 4oz sharp Cheddar, and the Fontina was still a bit overpowering. Tonight, I’ll go with a milder Danish Fontina. 3) It looked done, and I was worried about overdoing it, but when I cut into it, the very center was still oozey cheese. Tonight, I’ll bake 5 min longer before broiling.

Fantastic! A well vetted recipe. I made it this evening and used the broccoli rabe… Used the springform pan. Your instructions were dead on! I didn’t need to finish the pie under the broiler as recommended –  the pie was set and perfectly browned at 45 minutes. The aromas were enticing and the meal was absolutely delicious! Many thanks!

I made this over the weekend, I left out the greens and served them on the side, but I added leftover diced sautéed ham, it was great, required about 10 extra minutes of cooking. I did lighten it up a little with 2 percent milk and light shredded mozzarella but I did use regular pecorino, it was still incredibly rich and delicious.

I made a HALF RECIPE in a ceramic 9″ deep dish pie plate, using: 3 oz minced broccolini tops (from a 1.5 lb bundle), 8 oz spaghetti, 1/2 c. milk, 2 T. powdered milk (suggested by #56 marcella from italy, so I didn’t have to dry broccolini), 2 large eggs, 1 t. pepper, 1 t. kosher salt, 4 oz parmesan, 2 oz fontina. It was plenty cheesy and peppery; very tasty. The pie plate was not full, and the custard did not reach the top of the noodles, so next time I would use 3/4 c. milk.  Baked 30 min for a crunchy top, but could have called it done at 25 min.

So good!  It was good enough to cause me to write my first comment.  I replaced the fontina with swiss and the broccoli rabe with kale.  I used a large cast iron skillet.  I could smell it cooking all the way across my apartment.  And now I’m so happy having eaten it.  Thanks Deb, another winning recipe.
One question — any thoughts on the best way to reheat the leftovers?  I live alone and this was a massive recipe.

I made it! I think I just saw it on your Instagram and I HAD to make it; it just looked to good not to.  It turned out super delish, but I have to say that I made a few changes: I mixed in about 2 tbsp of chopped parsley and another for sprinkling over the top; I used parmesan instead of the pecorino and 1/2 mozzarella, 1/2 white cheddar (a very nice Vermont cheddar), for purely economic reasons. This is a true keeper! Had it with a simple spinach salad. I get to eat my other wedge for lunch tomorrow…ha ha! Also, I followed your instructions with the foil, and there was still about 1/3 of a cup of the custard that spilled out. Trying to think of a way to keep that from happening. Thank you much for the recipe. It turned out pretty, too!  :-)

made this last night-really nice idea and taste. mine did, however, turn out quite ?dry. i followed the directions with the exception of switching parmesan for the pecorino, taste preference. i’m guessing that i over baked it? or 425 is just a tad too high of a temp? i don’t know but the next time i will lower the temperature and take it out ten min sooner. or do you think more milk is needed? for sure very dry! but we enjoyed it just the same. thank you!
