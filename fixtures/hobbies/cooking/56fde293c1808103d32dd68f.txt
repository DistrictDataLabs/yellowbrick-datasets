i get it now, hawaii. i get why everyone i've ever met who has been to hawaii goes bonkers at any mention of it and i'm pleased as plum to say that after just three days here, i, too, will roll my eyes to the back of my head and groan uncontrollably at any mention of this gosh darn beautiful state. 

my pops calls his little brown lake house in michigan the relaxation capital of the universe, but he's wrong. it's here, where the sun-filled days begin with snap chatting the ocean and end with nougats and giggles in the hot tub. if the week before my book deadline was a stress level 10, and a deep tissue massage is a one, then i am currently at about a -30. 

i am off to go bask in this nonsense by sitting on the meditation lawn that is right outside my door, but i will leave you here with a cake.
