	 When I was a child, I was always a little difficult when it came time to eat my vegetables. But man, if my veggies looked like these rainbow rolls, I might've been more receptive to the whole idea.



	 Wrapped in chard leaves and filled with veggies of all colors of the rainbow, these beautiful rolls make the perfect gluten-free and vegan snack or light lunch. Prep them at home and bring them to work for a not-so-sad desk lunch. Whatever you do, don't forget the creamy miso sauce for dunking — it's the perfect complement to the crunchy rolls.
