	   So far, the most "American" sushi I've seen featured BBQ sauce and chicken tenders. But this ... this tops that.



	  In terms of, you know, eatability, sushi burgers seem to be a lot less effective than sushi burritos. They're not strong enough to pick up and eat like an actual burger, but I'm assuming that's a testament to the chef's respect for the integrity of the rice. Regardless, I'm a big fan of sushi in any form, so I wouldn't turn this away if it landed on the plate in front of me.



	 Apart from hungry, this discovery leaves me curious. Just how far can this trend go? I mean, we already have sushi burritos â€” why should we stop at burgers? Will sushi tacos storm the Taco Tuesday scene? Will sushi donuts be the next great breakfast treat? Will spiralized sushi sweep the nation as the next health-food craze? Will sushi cakes someday be served at birthday celebrations?



	 One can only hope.
