Brunch is one of my favorite meals, but it often involves a lot of last minute preparation if you are the one hosting it. Eggs, salads and baked goods all need to be prepared either just before people arrive, or just before you sit down to eat. You can help the eggs along by making a breakfast casserole, but you can save even more time by preparing this fantastic Overnight Coffee Cake. The coffee cake – and you can get the recipe over on the Craftsy blog (it’s free!) – and the streusel are both prepared the night before you intend to bake and the assembled cake is refrigerated until it is ready to go in the oven. The resulting cake has a soft, even crumb and just the right amount of crunchy streusel topping. Your guests will never know how much time you saved (or that you got to sleep in for an extra hour!) by serving up this amazing cake.

If you prefer nuts in your coffee cake, you can stir in about a 1/2 cup or so of finely chopped nuts while preparing the batter. The same goes for chocolate chips or other “dry” mix-ins.
