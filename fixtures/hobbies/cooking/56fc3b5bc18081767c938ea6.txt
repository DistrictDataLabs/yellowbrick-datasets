Skinnytaste Dinner Plan (Week 20)

Hi everyone! I’m back from another week in Charleston where I was shooting the second half of my new cookbook, Skinnytaste Fast and Slow (comes out this Fall). While there I did a book signing at the Charleston Wine + Food Festival, got to try some new restaurants and did some sight seeing, if you haven’t been there yet it’s a must!  

This is week 20 of sharing my weekly dinner plans. I use The Skinnytaste Meal Planner pictured below to plan my dinners for the week (you can of course use any meal planner). 


A
 52-week meal planner, food tracker and exercise tracker in one. I’ve
included the Smart Points next to the recipes since I am currently on
Weight Watchers. Also, if you have The Skinnytaste Cookbook, and currently on Weight Watchers, I have all the Smart Points listed here for your convenience.Meal planning is a great way to get organized before heading to the supermarket to get ready for the week! My
 breakfast is usually something quick like eggs with fruit, a smoothie
or avocado toast. We’re a family of four, so if a recipe serves
more, it’s either packed up for everyone’s lunch or eaten the next day as leftovers. If you would like to see some of the previous week’s dinner plans, click here.
