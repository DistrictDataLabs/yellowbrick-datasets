Anna Wise, the Grammy winner formerly of Sonnymoon who has collaborated with Kendrick Lamar, released a new video that sums up pretty beautifully a core reason for the continued importance of feminist discussion today: after all the work that has been done, women are still apt to fall subject to the frigid/fast binary. She says it much catchier than that, though, in the appropriately named “BitchSlut.” Watch the video, shot by LA’s Patti Miller, after the jump and read more about Wise via Consequence of Sound.
