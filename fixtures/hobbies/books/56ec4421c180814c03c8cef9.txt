We’ve collected the books debuting on Indiebound’s Indie Bestseller List for the week ending March 13, 2016–a sneak peek at the books everybody will be talking about next month.

(Debuted at #1 in Young Adult) Lady Midnight by Cassandra Clare: “It’s been five years since the events of City of Heavenly Fire that brought the Shadowhunters to the brink of oblivion. Emma Carstairs is no longer a child in mourning, but a young woman bent on discovering what killed her parents and avenging her losses.” (March 2016)

(Debuted at #9 in Early & Middle Grade Readers) The Gutsy Girl written by Caroline Paul and illustrated by Wendy MacNaughton: “Why should girls miss out on the joy of adventure? They can jump off rocks, swing on ropes, and climb trees just as well as boys can. But girls often allow fear to stand in their way.” (March 2016)

(Debuted at #14 in Hardcover Nonfiction) Smarter Faster Better by Charles Duhigg: “Drawing on the latest findings in neuroscience, psychology, and behavioral economics—as well as the experiences of CEOs, educational reformers, four-star generals, FBI agents, airplane pilots, and Broadway songwriters—this painstakingly researched book explains that the most productive people, companies, and organizations don’t merely act differently. They view the world, and their choices, in profoundly different ways.” (March 2016)
