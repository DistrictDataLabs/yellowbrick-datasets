The Wellcome Book Prize shortlist has been revealed. Joan Bakewell, The Chair of Judges, revealed the nominees which were selected by a committee of authors, journalists and academics.

Six books, including memoirs, fiction and non-fiction, were selected. “The shortlist reflects what has moved and inspired us most about books that deal with intimate and often complex matters of the human body and human experience,” stated Bakewell. “Each one has found its way not just onto the shortlist, but into our hearts.”

We’ve got the list after the jump.
