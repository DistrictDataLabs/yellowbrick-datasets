Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg have reportedly signed on to work on MGM’s film adaptation of Martin Handford’s children’s book franchise Where’s Waldo.

According to a report on Deadline.com, “Rogen and Goldberg will become producers with their Point Grey partner James Weaver,” and “…the studio and Classic Media are setting Kyle Hunter & Ariel Shaffir to write it.”

MGM president Jonathan Glickman has secured the film rights to the franchise back in 2011. Handford published seven primary books in the Where’s Waldo? series. The franchise’s non-picture book publications include fact guides, activity books and puzzle books.
