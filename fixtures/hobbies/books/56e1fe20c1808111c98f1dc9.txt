After forty-five years of playing in Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young, Graham Nash has announced that he is done with tolerating—and mollifying—David Crosby’s notoriously big, cantankerous mouth. Nash told Billboard, “In my world, there will never, ever be a Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young record and there will never be another Crosby, Stills, and Nash record or show.” He went a bit further in an earlier interview with the magazine Lust for Life, saying:

I don’t like David Crosby right now. He’s been awful for me the last two years, just f**king awful. I’ve been there and saved his f**king ass for 45 years, and he treated me like s**t. You can’t do that to me. You can do it for a day or so, until I think you’re going to come around. When it goes on longer, and I keep getting nasty emails from him, I’m done. F**k you. David has ripped the heart out of Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young… How can I not be sad?

On a more positive note, Nash is preparing to tour for his solo album, The Path Tonight, which will be out April 15. You do you, Nash.
