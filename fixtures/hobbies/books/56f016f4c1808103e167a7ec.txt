Emily Browning (pictured, via) has landed the role of Laura Moon on the American Gods TV show. Earlier this year, Starz and FremantleMedia North America announced two castings: Ian McShane will play Mr. Wednesday and Ricky Whittle will play Shadow Moon.

Empire Magazine reports that Browning’s character is the wife of Shadow Moon. The story for this adaptation project comes from Neil Gaiman’s popular 2001 novel.

Here’s more from Deadline: “The plot of American Gods posits a war brewing between old and new gods: the traditional gods of mythological roots from around the world steadily losing believers to an upstart pantheon of gods reflecting society’s modern love of money, technology, media, celebrity and drugs. Its protagonist, Shadow Moon, is an ex-con who becomes bodyguard and traveling partner to Mr. Wednesday, a conman who in reality is one of the older gods, on a cross-country mission to gather his forces in preparation to battle the new deities.” (via Neil Gaiman’s Tumblr Page)
