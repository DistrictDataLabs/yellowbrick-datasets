During our last class, students will meet in mock award groups. We did this for the first time last year and it went surprisingly well. This year the class is larger, which means there will be four Caldecott committees instead of two. Like last year, we will follow the terms and criteria as outlined by the ALA/ALSC:

Every committee has 5-7 students, each nominating and presenting one book published in 2015. After all the books have been presented, they will discuss their slates, vote, and present their winning books to the class.

I love seeing all the overlaps. Not surprisingly, several picture books will be discussed by more than one Caldecott Committee (Boats for Papa on two, Finding Winnie on three, Float on two, Last Stop on Market Street on all four, Waiting on two, Water is Water on two). I was more surprised to see Waiting also show up on Geisel and Finding Winnie on the Sibert roster.

Which book in each group do you think is the most worthy, and why?
