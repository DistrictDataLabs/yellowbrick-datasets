Molly Bang’s Picture This is her personal exploration as she works to analyze the emotional effects of art. Most illustrators go with their gut as they compose their pictures, but Molly wanted to see if there were some rules involved. An experienced illustrator, she says she began to understand art and composition better through this exploration. This book was originally written for adults, but I know some teachers in later elementary and middle school who use the exercises in the second half of this book.

Do Molly’s explorations resonate for you? Help you understand pictures and illustration?
