## Abstract

Experimental data used for binary classification (room occupancy) from Temperature, Humidity, Light and CO2. Ground-truth occupancy was obtained from time stamped pictures that were taken every minute.

## Description

Three data sets are submitted, for training and testing. Ground-truth occupancy was obtained from time stamped pictures that were taken every minute. For the journal publication, the processing R scripts can be found on GitHub: [https://github.com/LuisM78/Occupancy-detection-data](https://github.com/LuisM78/Occupancy-detection-data)

## Attributes

- datetime `year-month-day hour:minute:second`
- temperature (celsius)
- relative humidity (%)
- light (lux)
- carbon dioxide (ppm)
- humidity ratio (kgwater-vapor/kg-air)
- occupancy (1 for occupied, 0 for not occupied)
